# Solution for Issue #669 
I found a broken link from the website. 
Please see [Julep-ai/Julep Issue # 669](https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/issues/669).
I can not find the website files in this repository.  So instead I am submitting it as a file here with my proposed solution.

In the file that redirects the footer "Docs" link, simply change the href to direct to "https://docs.julep.ai/", instead of "https://docs.julep.ai/introduction/readme".  

Once I was at the [Link from the footer](https://docs.julep.ai/introduction/readme), if I clicked on the "README" text on the top left, the page worked as expected, so I copied the working url to propose it replace the current footer href.
