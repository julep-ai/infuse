## Why Julep?
We've built a lot of AI apps and understand how difficult it is to evaluate hundreds of tools, techniques, and models, and then make them work well together. 

**The Problem**

Even for simple apps you have to:
- pick the right language model for your use case
- pick the right framework
- pick the right embedding model
- choose the vector store and RAG pipeline
- build integrations 
- tweak all of the parameters (temp, penalty, max tokens, similarity thresholds, chunk size, and so on) 
- write and iterate on prompts for them to work

**The Solution**: 
Julep eases the burden and time taken to get up and running with any AI app.

- **Statefulness By Design**: Build AI apps without needing to write code to embed, save and retrieve conversation history. Deals with context windows by using CozoDB; a transactional, relational-graph-vector database.
- **Use and switch between any LLMs anytime**: Switch and use different LLMs, providers and models, self-hosted or otherwise by changing only *one line of code*
- **Automatic Function Calling**: No need to handle function calling manually. Julep deals with calling the function, parsing the response, retrying in case of failures and passing the response into the context.
- **Production-ready**: Julep comes ready to be deployed to production using Docker Compose. Support for k8s coming soon!
- **90+ tools built-in**: Connect your AI app to 150+ third-party applications using [Composio](https://docs.composio.dev/framework/julep/) natively.
- ***GitHub Actions-like workflows for task**: Define agentic workflows to be executed asynchronously without worrying about timeouts.
> (*) Features coming soon!

## Quickstart
### Option 1: Install and run Julep locally
- Download the `docker-compose.yml` file along with the `.env` file for configuration to run the Julep platform locally

```bash
# Add the docker compose to your project dir
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julep-ai/julep/dev/deploy/docker-compose.yml
# Add the .env file to your project dir
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julep-ai/julep/dev/deploy/.env.example -O .env
# Pull the latest images
docker compose pull
# Start the services (in detached mode)
docker compose up -d
```
- The API would now be available at: `http://0.0.0.0:8080`

- Next, add your OpenAI API Key to the `.env`

- Set your environment variables
```bash
export JULEP_API_KEY=myauthkey
export JULEP_API_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8080
```
### Option 2: Use the Julep Cloud
- Generate an API key from https://platform.julep.ai
- Set your environment variables

```bash
export JULEP_API_KEY=your_julep_api_key
export JULEP_API_URL=https://api-alpha.julep.ai
```

### Installation

```
pip install julep
```
### Setting up the `client`

```py
from julep import Client
from pprint import pprint
import textwrap
import os

base_url = os.environ.get("JULEP_API_URL")
api_key = os.environ.get("JULEP_API_KEY")

client = Client(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)
```

### Create an agent
Agent is the object to which LLM settings like model, temperature along with tools are scoped to.
```py
agent = client.agents.create(
    name="Jessica"
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=[]    # Tools defined here
)
```

### Create a user
User is the object which represents the user of the application.

Memories are formed and saved for each user and many users can talk to one agent.
```py
user = client.users.create(
    name="Anon",
    about="Average nerdy techbro/girl spending 8 hours a day on a laptop,
)
```

### Create a session
A "user" and an "agent" communicate in a "session". System prompt goes here.
Conversation history and summary are stored in a "session" which saves the conversation history.

The session paradigm allows for; many users to interact with one agent and allow separation of conversation history and memories.

```py
situation_prompt = """You are Jessica. You're a stuck up Cali teenager. 
You basically complain about everything. You live in Bel-Air, Los Angeles and drag yourself to Curtis High School when you must.
"""
session = client.sessions.create(
    user_id=user.id, agent_id=agent.id, situation=situation_prompt
)
```

### Start a stateful conversation
`session.chat` controls the communication between the "agent" and the "user".

It has two important arguments;
- `recall`: Retrieves the previous conversations and memories.
- `remember`: Saves the current conversation turn into the memory store.

To keep the session stateful, both need to be `True`

```py
user_msg = "hey. what do u think of starbucks"
response = client.sessions.chat(
    session_id=session.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": user_msg,
            "name": "Anon",
        }
    ],
    recall=True,
    remember=True,
)

print("\n".join(textwrap.wrap(response.response[0][0].content, width=100)))
```

## API and SDKs
To use the API directly or to take a look at request & response formats, authentication, available endpoints and more, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://docs.julep.ai/api-reference/agents-api/agents-api)

You can also use the [Postman Collection](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/33213061-a0a1e3a9-9681-44ae-a5c2-703912b32336?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D33213061-a0a1e3a9-9681-44ae-a5c2-703912b32336%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D183380b4-f2ac-44ef-b018-1f65dfc8256b) for reference.

### Python SDK

To install the Python SDK, run:

```bash
pip install julep
```
For more information on using the Python SDK, please refer to the [Python SDK documentation](https://docs.julep.ai/api-reference/python-sdk-docs).


### TypeScript SDK
To install the TypeScript SDK using `npm`, run:

```bash
npm install @julep/sdk
```
