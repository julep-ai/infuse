He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small

<dlg>To my Chris, I have been thinking
about how I could possibly tell you
how much you mean to me. I remember
when I first started to fall in
love with you like it was last
night. Lying naked beside you in
that tiny apartment, it suddenly
hit me that I was part of this
whole larger thing, just like our
parents, and our parents' parents.
Before that I was just living my
life like I knew everything, and
suddenly this bright light hit me
and woke me up. That light was you.</dlg>
<act>Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys
writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the
memories he's describing.</act>

<dlg>I can't believe it's already been
50 years since you married me. And
still to this day, every day, you
make me feel like the girl I was
when you first turned on the lights
and woke me up and we started this
adventure together. Happy
Anniversary, my love and my friend
til the end. Loretta. Print.</dlg>
<act>Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the
screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed
into a handwritten letter on blue stationery.</act>
<act>As he says "Loretta," we see "Loretta" being handwritten at
the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on
the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is
tagged "Chris" and "Me - Loretta." Underneath is a bullet
point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband
Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after
college, have had the greatest life together.</act>
<act>Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful
robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen
handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy.</act>
<act>Her pg. 2</act>
<act>He puts the printed letter on a stack of other printed
letters to Chris and starts a new one. There is also a stack
of finished letters in their envelopes - an assortment of
beautiful stationery in all shapes and sizes.</act>

<dlg>I cannot believe after eight years
how petty the argument was that
actually ended it. We came home and
he asked me if I'd put my shoes
next to the door where he likes to
put the shoes. I don't want to be
told where to put my shoes. I want
to just sit on the sofa for a
minute and relax. And so we argued
for ten minutes about that and
about how he's just trying to make
our house a home. I say he's
overwhelming, he says I'm not
trying hard enough. I say that's
all I'm doing is trying, but I'm
just not trying the way he wants me
to. He's trying to control the way
I'm trying. And I think we must
have had this argument hundreds of
times before and I finally had to
stop because I couldn't be in that
situation anymore where we were
making each other feel bad about
ourselves. So I said I'm going to

them, I shared them with my wife
when I got home. Many made us

something of ourselves. The

a complete piece. (I did that.)

these out in a mock up and we're
posting it to your address. We'd
love to meet with you and move
forward.
Yours, Michael Wadsworth"</dlg>

<dlg>It's like I'm reading a book, and
it's a book I deeply love, but I'm
reading it slowly now so the words
are really far apart and the spaces
between the words are almost
infinite. I can still feel you and
the words of our story, but it's in
this endless space between the
words that I'm finding myself now.
It's a place that's not of the
physical world - it's where
everything else is that I didn't
even know existed. I love you so
much, but this is where I am now.

<dlg>Dear Catherine. I've been sitting
here thinking about all the things
I wanted to apologize to you for.
All the pain we caused each other,
everything I put on you -
everything I needed you to be or
needed you to say. I'm sorry for
that. I will always love you
because we grew up together. And
you helped make me who I am. I just
wanted you to know there will be a
piece of you in me always, and I'm
grateful for that. Whatever someone
you become, and wherever you are in
the world, I'm sending you love.
You're my friend til the end. Love,
Theodore.</dlg>

on the unfinished cement. Amy's hair as she's hit with wind

<act>Theodore leads Amy onto the roof. The city is absolutely
quiet. The sun isn't up yet. The city is just beginning to be
lit with the earliest morning blue/purple hue.</act>
<act>They wander around the roof separately, lost in thought,
taking in the city. He breathes in the cold morning air. He
stares at small details: a tattered inspection tag tied to a
water meter, flapping in the wind; a lone car driving down a
boulevard ten blocks away; a dirty abandoned sock.</act>
<act>Eventually he sits down next to Amy and she puts her hand on
his hand. He puts his other hand on top of her hand. He looks
at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb. He
looks out at the city and exhales. The sun is just starting
to break. She puts her head on his shoulder. They watch as
hundreds of birds fly around the nearby rooftops and disperse
off into the city.</act>
