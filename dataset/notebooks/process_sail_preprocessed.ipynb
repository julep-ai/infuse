       "{'prompt': '(1) \"Zebra mussel\"\\nZebra mussel The zebra mussel (\"\"Dreissena polymorpha\"\") is a small freshwater mussel. This species was originally native to the lakes of southern Russia and Ukraine. However, the zebra mussel has been accidentally introduced to numerous other areas, and has become an invasive species in many countries worldwide. Since the 1980s, they have invaded the Great Lakes and the Hudson River. The species was first described in 1769 by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in the Ural, Volga, and Dnieper rivers. Zebra mussels get their name from a striped pattern commonly seen on their shells, though it is not universally',\n",

Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): These small mussels were introduced to the Great Lakes in the 1980s and have since spread across North America. They outcompete and displace native species, damage infrastructure, and alter ecosystems.\\n\\n2. Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata): This fast-growing vine was introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant and for erosion control. It quickly became invasive in the southeastern US, smothering native vegetation and trees.\\n\\n3. Asian Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix): These fast-growing and hardy fish were imported to the United States for aquaculture and have since spread into the Mississippi and Illinois river systems. They outcompete and displace native species and can cause ecological damage.\\n\\n4. Burmese Python (Python bivittatus): This large snake was introduced to the Florida Everglades as released or escaped pets. They have become a threat to native wildlife, preying on a wide range of mammals and birds.\\n\\n5.
