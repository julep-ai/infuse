       "{'article': \"Customers could soon design their own items, go into a supermarket and have them printed in 3D, if an ambitious major project by Tesco succeeds. The high street retail giant is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores. Ideas include digitally making clothing, furniture, personal gifts and even food in their shops. The supermarket giant is keen to use new technologies to offer a wider range of products to consumers. Company researchers believe 3D printers are a natural progression given that they already offer photo and poster printing . The project could also see Tesco stores repair broken items or print spare parts for a product that has already been purchased. Paul Wilkinson, a lead research specialist with Tesco, revealed the retail giant’s ambitions writing a blog post on tesco.com about the potential of 3D printing. He said: '3D printing] could revolutionise the way we view stores and what we can get from them.' Wilkinson, who is heading on a fact-finding mission to San Francisco with a team from Tesco, added in The Grocer magazine: 'We already print photos and posters in many of our larger stores, so why not other gifts and personalised items? 'How about letting kids design their own toys and then actually being able to get them made? What if we had a digital catalogue of spare parts for items that you’d bought? 3D printing is burgeoning industry with all manner of objects, such as this gun, now being created. 'They could be printed on demand and ready for you by the time you’d finished your shopping. You could even take a broken item into store; we could scan it in 3D, repair it digitally and make you a new one. 'There’s been a lot of buzz recently. It’s great that we have one of the machines to test out and to be able to look at how they might change the way stores work.' He said the Tesco team would be meeting “some of the big names and getting together with lots of start-ups and trying to find that idea or product that might just change the retail world.' This is not the first time 3D technology has attracted headlines after it was revealed recently a printed gun had been digitally made.  The blueprints for the gun were then posted on a website and downloaded over 100,000 times. The Mail on Sunday also printed their own gun and demonstrated how easy it was to get it through immigration and security.\",\n",
