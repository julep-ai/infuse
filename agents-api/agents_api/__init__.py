"""
The `agents_api` module serves as the foundation of the agent management system within the `agents-api` project. This module is responsible for defining the structure and capabilities of the API that manages agents. It includes operations such as creating, updating, listing, and deleting agents, as well as managing documents and tools associated with these agents. This file, in particular, acts as a configuration and initialization point for the `agents_api` package, and as per the directive, should not contain any imports.
