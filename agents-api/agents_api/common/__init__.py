"""
The `common` module serves as a foundational layer for the agents-api application, providing essential utilities, protocol definitions, and a structured approach to exception handling that are leveraged across various parts of the application.

- The `exceptions` submodule defines custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios related to agents, sessions, and users. This facilitates a more structured and informative error handling mechanism.

- The `protocol` submodule contains definitions and interfaces that standardize communication and data exchange within the application, ensuring consistency and clarity in how data is structured and transmitted.

- The `utils` submodule offers utility functions that perform common tasks and operations, such as date and time manipulation, JSON processing, etc., thereby reducing code duplication and promoting reusability.
