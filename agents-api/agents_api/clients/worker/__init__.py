This module provides functionality for interacting with an external worker service. It includes utilities for creating and sending tasks, such as memory management tasks, to be processed by the service. The module leverages asynchronous HTTP requests via the `httpx` library to communicate with the worker service. Types for structuring task data are defined in `types.py`.
