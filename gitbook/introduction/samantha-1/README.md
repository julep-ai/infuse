# Samantha-1

## Motivation

With the growing need for AI-enabled conversation interfaces, we identified a gap in the market for a solution that is both easy to integrate and provides granular control over the conversation. With Samantha-1 and our stateful API, we aim to fill this gap, providing a service that is robust, customizable, and user-friendly.

### Why Samantha

The idea of building an AI that not only knows us but grows with us is fascinating, and something I believe has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology. To achieve this, we realized we needed two things: an AI model with emotive and empathetic capabilities and a sophisticated memory system that could continually learn from users.

Before Samantha, we had built an AI sales agent for Shopify stores. While working on this project, we realized the need for continual learning to tailor conversations and find relevant user recommendations. We also found that existing models from OpenAI et al. weren't adaptable at all for creating consistent and expressive personalities.&#x20;

So, we ended up creating Samantha initially for ourselves. However, as we shared what we were building, many people told us that they \*really\* wanted to use it for their own applications. That's when we realized the potential of Samantha and decided to transform it into a more accessible API.
