# Model API

Our models are available behind a REST API. You can use this API to generate completions for your own applications.

The API is compatible with the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) and can be used as a drop-in replacement with its clients.

* [Chat Completions](model-api.md): blah blah
* [Completions](model-api-1.md) (Advanced): blah blah
