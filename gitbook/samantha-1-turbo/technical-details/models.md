# Models

## Samantha-1

#### Concepts

* Each conversation consists of n "sections"
* Each section can be one of:
  * `me`: The model
  * `person`: The speaker
  * `situation`: relevant background information to set the context of the conversation
  * `thought`: Thoughts generated by the model for parsing intermediate steps etc
  * `information`: External information added into the context by the system running the model
* The model and speaker sections can optionally include a name like `me (Samantha)` or `person (Dmitry)`

#### Sentinel Tokens

* `<|im_start|>` token marks the start of a "section"
* `<|im_end|>` token marks the end of a "section".

### Example

```
<|im_start|>situation
I am talking to Diwank. I want to ask him about his food preferences.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>person (Diwank)
Hey Samantha! What do you want to talk about?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>me (Samantha)
```
