# FAQ + Tips

### Recommendations

* We would recommend using the Stateful API for most use cases. We automatically handle a lot of the grunt work involved.
* The Stateful API is a completely transparent abstraction so you know exactly what's happening behind-the-scenes. No needless _magic_ mumbo-jumbo.
* The Stateless API is, of course, always available if you need advanced control over your entire pipeline.

### **Pricing**

* We charge per 1000 tokens used.
* Pricing for both APIs is exactly the same and depends on which [model](technical-details/models.md) you choose to use.
* The only difference is that we need to use additional tokens in the background for the **Stateful API**.
