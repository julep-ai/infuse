# Memory and Learning FAQs

1. **What types of memory do Julep AI agents have?**  
    Julep AI agents possess three types of memory: episodic, for events; implicit, for behavioral insights; and semantic, for factual and conceptual information.

1. **How do these memory types enhance an agent’s interactions with users?**  
    Episodic memory allows agents to recall past events, implicit memory aids in understanding user preferences and behaviors, and semantic memory provides a knowledge base for factual queries.

1. **Can agents form new memories from each interaction?**  
    Yes, agents update their memories after each interaction, extracting new episodes, beliefs, and facts to improve future performance and personalization.

1. **How does an agent recall relevant memories during interactions?**  
    Agents use semantic search to retrieve the most relevant memories for a given context, ensuring that the information provided is tailored to the current interaction.

1. **Is there a limit to how much an agent can remember?**  
    While Julep AI employs strategies to handle vast amounts of data, the memory recall process is designed to be selective to maintain efficiency and relevance.

1. **What measures are in place to ensure the consistency of implicit memories?**  
    The platform ensures that implicit memories do not contradict by maintaining a high threshold for forming new beliefs and checking for consistency.

1. **How is user privacy protected in the memory system?**  
    Memories are user-specific and are not shared across sessions or with other users, upholding strict privacy standards and data segregation.

1. **Can I reset or delete an agent’s memories?**  
    Users have the ability to reset or delete memories within the platform to manage the information that their agents retain.

1. **How does semantic memory utilize ConceptNet?**  
    Semantic memory leverages ConceptNet to ground knowledge in a broader context, allowing agents to access a wide-ranging conceptual graph for information retrieval.

1. **What role does feedback play in an agent’s learning process?**  
    User feedback is instrumental in refining agents’ memories, where correct responses are reinforced and inaccuracies are corrected, promoting continuous learning.
