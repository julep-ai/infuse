# Agent Design and Prototyping FAQs

1. **What is an AI agent on the Julep AI platform?**  
    An AI agent is an application created on Julep AI that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously using AI, often through natural language processing and understanding.  

1. **How do I start designing an AI agent?**  
    Use the 'Create Agent' feature in the IDE to define your agent's purpose, capabilities, and the tools it will use. The platform guides you through setting parameters and writing initial prompts.  

1. **What tools are available for agent prototyping?**  
    Julep AI offers tools like function_call for structured input, webhooks for actions, built-in tools for document retrieval and search, and an API for integrating external services.  

1. **Can I prototype an agent without coding skills?**  
    Yes, the prompt IDE is designed to be user-friendly, allowing you to prototype agents using visual tools and pre-defined templates without needing to write code.  

1. **How can I test different prompting methods?**  
    Within the IDE, you can draft various prompts and immediately test them, allowing you to experiment with different approaches and select the most effective one.  

1. **What are the best practices for creating effective prompts?**  
    Keep prompts clear and concise, align them with your agent's intended functions, and iteratively refine them based on testing feedback to improve performance.  

1. **How does the immediate and visual feedback work in the IDE?**  
    When you test a prompt, the IDE displays the agent's response in real-time, along with visual indicators of performance, such as accuracy or relevance.  

1. **Is there a way to version control my agent prototypes?**  
    Julep AI's IDE integrates with version control systems, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members.  

1. **How do I ensure my agentâ€™s responses are accurate?**  
    Use the testing and benchmarking tools in the IDE to evaluate responses. You can also set up synthetic scenarios that mimic real-world use to further validate accuracy.  

1. **Can I get feedback on my agent design from other users?**  
    Yes, you can share your agent configurations with the community to get feedback, or collaborate with team members directly within the platform.
