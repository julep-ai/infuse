# Sessions and Tasks FAQs

1. **What is a 'Session' in Julep AI?**  
    A Session is a real-time interaction between a user and an AI agent, structured as a conversation with request-response exchanges, often resembling a chat interface.

1. **How do I start a Session with an agent?**  
    You can initiate a Session by selecting an agent and a user within the platform, which creates a unique session_id used to track the conversation.

1. **What is a 'Task' in Julep AI, and how is it different from a Session?**  
    A Task is a defined operation with multiple steps and objectives, intended to run over a longer duration than a Session. Tasks are like state machines that handle complex, multi-step processes.

1. **Can Sessions use the tools defined in an agent's configuration?**  
    Yes, Sessions can execute instant tools such as document lookups and API calls in real-time, using the results to inform responses within the conversation.

1. **How do agents manage memory within Sessions?**  
    During Sessions, agents automatically pull relevant memories to provide contextually appropriate responses and to maintain continuity in the interaction.

1. **What are Scheduled Tasks and how do they work?**  
    Scheduled Tasks are Tasks that are set to run at specific times or intervals. They are configured to trigger automatically, based on the parameters set by the user.

1. **How can I track the progress of a Task?**  
    Each Task run is associated with a unique run_id, which you can use to monitor the state transitions and overall progress through the platformâ€™s dashboard.

1. **Are there limits on the length or complexity of a Session or Task?**  
    While Sessions are designed for shorter interactions, they can handle complex dialogues. Tasks, however, are better suited for operations with multiple steps and can run for extended periods.

1. **How do I end a Session or Task?**  
    Sessions typically end when the user's immediate needs are met or when manually concluded by the user. Tasks end when the objective is achieved or if the state machine reaches a terminal state.

1. **Can I intervene in a running Task if needed?**  
    Yes, users have the capability to intervene in active Tasks, either to adjust parameters, add inputs, or manually steer the Task towards conclusion or cancellation.
