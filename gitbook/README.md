# Overview

## What is Julep AI?

Julep AI is a platform for rapid prototyping, and deployment of AI agents. Agents are autonomous applications that use LLMs to plan and perform complex tasks without human oversight. They operate by planning steps, selecting appropriate tools, and executing actions to accomplish practical, everyday tasks that require reasoning.

At its core, Julep AI comprises the following:
1. A simple and intuitive **framework for building Agents**,
1. A **memory-store** that agents use to continuously learn from their interactions with users and their environment,
1. A web-based **Agent IDE** that allows iterating on agents and complicated prompts is both versatile for developers and approachable for those with less coding experience,
1. A robust **agent execution infrastructure** that can run agent tasks and inference at scale, and
1. An **ecosystem of tools and integrations** for use by agents on the platform.

Julep AI stands out by enabling agents with a form of 'memory', allowing them to save and utilize past interactions and states to make informed decisions and follow through with tasks over time. This memory system is the cornerstone of the platform.
