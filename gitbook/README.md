# Overview

## What is Julep AI?

Julep AI is a platform designed for the rapid development, prototyping, and deployment of AI agents. These agents are autonomous applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that can perform a variety of tasks without constant human oversight. They operate by planning steps, selecting appropriate tools, and executing actions in a manner that mimics cognitive processes, effectively bridging the gap between complex AI technologies and practical, everyday applications.

At its core, Julep AI provides a robust infrastructure that supports the entire lifecycle of an AI agent â€“ from the initial idea scribbled on a virtual napkin to a fully-functional system integrated within a user's environment. The platform is web-based, offering a Prompt Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and execution platform that is both versatile for developers and approachable for those with less coding experience.

Julep AI stands out by enabling agents with a form of 'memory', allowing them to save and utilize past interactions and states to make informed decisions and follow through with tasks over time. This memory system is not only a technical feat but also a cornerstone of the platform's capability to deliver personalized and context-aware services.

To put it plainly, think of Julep AI as a workshop where you can craft smart, memory-equipped digital helpers that learn and adapt as they work, ready to be deployed into the digital world to handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence and effort.
