# Model API

* [Chat Completions](model-api/model-api.md): Chat completion generates responses from conversations (JSON lists).
* [Completions](model-api/model-api-1.md) (Advanced): Access to the underlying model in raw chatml format. Meant only for advanced users.

{% hint style="success" %}
The API is compatible with the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) and can be used as a drop-in replacement with its clients.
