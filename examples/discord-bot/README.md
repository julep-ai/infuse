# Python Discord Bot

This is a minimal example bot built using the discord.py library and the Julep API for creating interactive Discord bots. It serves as a starting point for making your own Discord bot. Read [their getting-started guides](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#getting-started) to get the most out of this template.

## Getting Started

To get set up, you'll need to follow [these bot account setup instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html),
and then copy the token for your bot and added it as an environment variable.


You would also need the [GIPHY API key](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/) saved in the environment variable.
