    "# Task Definition: Customer Support Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This task implements an automated system to index and process QuickBlox's website. The system crawls the QuickBlox website, extracts relevant information, and creates a searchable knowledge base that can be queried programmatically. Finally, it creates a chatbot that can answer questions about the website using the RAG knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **spider_crawler**: Web crawler component for systematically traversing the QuickBlox website\n",
    "- **create_agent_doc**: Document processor for converting web content into indexed, searchable documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "Required parameter:\n",
    "- **url**: Entry point URL for the crawler (e.g., \"https://quickblox.com/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexed knowledge base containing processed QuickBlox documentation\n",
    "- Query interface for programmatic access to the documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an agent with the spider_crawler tool\n",
    "2. Get the Spider tool's API key \n",
    "3. Crawl website using spider_crawler tool:\n",
    "    - Specify URL and page limit\n",
    "    - Enable smart mode, proxy, readability\n",
    "    - Filter out images and SVGs\n",
    "    - Use sentence-based chunking (15 sentences per chunk)\n",
    "4. For each crawled page:\n",
    "    - Extract content\n",
    "    - Break into chunks\n",
    "    - Generate succinct context for each chunk\n",
    "    - Combine chunk with context\n",
    "5. Create agent documents:\n",
    "    - Store processed chunks as documents\n",
    "    - Add metadata like source\n",
    "    - Index for search/retrieval\n",
    "6. Finally chat with the agent in the session and retrieve the documents that are relevant to the user's query\n",
