    "# Task Definition: Sarcastic News Headline Generator using DuckDuckGo Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is designed to generate a sarcastic news headline on a specific topic provided by the user. The process utilizes a web search to gather additional information and context about the topic and then uses that information to create a headline with a sarcastic tone. Below is a breakdown of how the task works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: The user provides a topic for the sarcastic news headline. For example, this could be \"technology\" or \"politics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Search Tool using DuckDuckGo Integration**: \n",
    "   - A search is conducted to find additional information about the topic. The search engine looks for funny or humorous content related to the given subject. \n",
    "   - This helps in gathering relevant context and funny details to be used in the headline generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Headline Creation by the Agent**: \n",
    "   - Based on the topic and the gathered information, the system generates a sarcastic news headline. The result is a headline that mixes factual or common perceptions of the topic with humor and sarcasm.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Output**: The final result is a sarcastic, witty headline on the given topic, which can be used for entertainment or as a creative writing prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This task leverages web search to enhance the system's ability to generate sarcastic content, making the results more contextually relevant and amusing."
