It is shown that unconventional quantum computing devices can in prin-\\\\n                 ciple compute some quantities more rapidly than ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\\\n\\\\n                      Computers are physical: what they can and cannot do is determined by the laws\\\\n                 of physics. When scientific progress augments or revises those laws, our picture of what\\\\n                 computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is generally accepted as the\\\\n                 fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behave. Quantum computers can\\\\n                 in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computational tasks that classical com-\\\\n                 puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should turn out to be incomplete\\\\n                 or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will change. In addition, the set\\\\n                 of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essentially any coherent quantum\\\\n                 phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom can\\\\n                 in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This paper discusses how the revi-\\\\n                 sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phenomena can lead to new\\\\n                 technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.\\\\n                      Since new quantum effects are discovered seemingly every day, let‚Äôs first discuss two\\\\n                 basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum\\\\n                 computation. These are 1) The phenomenon must be nonlinear, and 2) It must be coherent.\\\\n                 To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some form of nonlinearity, e.g.,\\\\n                 a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom. Without such a nonlinearity\\\\n                 quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot perform even so simple a nonlinear\\\\n                 operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisite for performing tasks\\\\n                 such as factoring using Shor‚Äôs algorithm [10], quantum simulation a la Feynman [11] and\\\\n                 Lloyd [12], or Grover‚Äôs data-base search algorithm [13], all of which require extended\\\\n                 manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.\\\\n\\\\n                                                                        1\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'066b2185-7165-468b-84f7-b8866f9baa4f\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'      The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-\\\\nnomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in principle sufficient. As shown\\\\nin [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-\\\\nfices to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be assembled into a quantum\\\\ncomputer. In addition, the work of Preskill et al. [18] on robust quantum computation\\\\nshows that an error rate of no more than 10‚àí4 per quantum logic operation allows one to\\\\nperform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principle.\\\\n      In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are likely to prove sufficiently\\\\ncontrollable to provide extended quantum computation. Promising devices under current\\\\nexperimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high finesse cavities for manipulating\\\\nlight and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and molecular systems that can be\\\\nmade to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Such devices store quantum\\\\ninformation on the states of quantum systems such as photons, atoms, or nuclei, and\\\\naccomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the\\\\napplication of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser fields. We will call such\\\\ndevices ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been\\\\nconstructed.\\\\n      There is another sense in which such computers are conventional: although the de-\\\\nvices described above have already been used to explore new regimes in physics and to\\\\ncreate and investigate the properties of new and exotic quantum states of matter, they\\\\nfunction according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the\\\\nmost striking examples of the ‚Äòconventionality‚Äô of current quantum logic devices are NMR\\\\nquantum microprocessors that are operated using techniques that have been refined for\\\\nalmost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though\\\\ncertainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electrodynamic regime where the\\\\nfundamental physics has been understood for decades (that is not to say that new and\\\\nunexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime, rather that there is general\\\\nagreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).\\\\n      Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic device is the best kind of\\\\nquantum logic device to have around. It is exactly because the physics of nuclear magnetic\\\\nresonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this\\\\nphysics can be used systematically to construct and manipulate the exotic quantum states\\\\nthat form the basis for quantum computation. With that recognition, let us turn to\\\\n\\\\n                                                         2\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'bcf5f805-d98f-4076-aa8c-f753cf7dbfa1\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'‚Äòunconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\\\n      Perhaps the most obvious basis for an unconventional quantum computer is the use\\\\nof particles with non-Boltzmann statistics in a refime where these statistics play a key role\\\\nin the dynamics of the device. For example, Lloyd [16] has proposed the use of fermions\\\\nas the fundamental carriers of quantum information, so that a site or state occupied by a\\\\nfermion represents a 1 and an unoccupied site or state represents a 0. It is straightforward\\\\nto design a universal quantum computer using a conditional hopping dynamics on an array\\\\nof sites, in which a fermion hops from one site to another if only if other sites are occupied.\\\\n      If the array is one-dimensional, then such a fermionic quantum computer is equivalent\\\\nto a conventional quantum computer via the well-known technique of bosonization. If the\\\\narray is two or more dimensional, however, a local operation involving fermions on the\\\\nlattice cannot be mocked up by a local operation on a conventional quantum computer,\\\\nwhich must explicitly keep track of the phases induced by Fermi statistics. As a result,\\\\nsuch a fermionic computer can perform certain operations more rapidly than a conventional\\\\nquantum computer. An obvious example of a problem that can be solved more rapidly on\\\\na fermionic quantum computer is the problem of simulating a lattice fermionic system in\\\\ntwo or more dimensions. To get the antisymmetrization right in second quantized form,\\\\na conventional ‚ÄòBoltzmann‚Äô quantum computer takes time proportional to T ‚Ñìd‚àí1 where T\\\\nis the time over which the simulation is to take place, ‚Ñì is the length of the lattice and\\\\nd is the dimension, while a fermionic quantum computer takes time proportional to T .\\\\n(Here we assume that the computations for both conventional and Fermionic quantum\\\\ncomputers can take advantage of the intrinsic parallelizability of such simulations: if the\\\\ncomputations are performed serially an additional factro of ‚Ñìd is required for both types\\\\nof computer to update each site sequentially.)\\\\n      As the lattice size ‚Ñì and the dimension d grow large, the difference between the two\\\\ntypes of computer also grows large. Indeed, the problem of simulating fermions hopping\\\\non a hypercube of dimension d as d ‚Üí ‚àû is evidently exponentially harder on a con-\\\\nventional quantum computer than a Fermionic quantum computer. Since a variety of\\\\ndifficult problems such as the travelling-salesman problem and data-base search problem\\\\ncan be mapped to particles hopping on a hypercube, it is interesting to speculate whether\\\\nfermionic computers might provide an exponential speed-up on problems of interest in ad-\\\\ndition to quantum simulation. No such problems are currently known, however. Fermionic\\\\ncomputers could be realized in principle by manipulating the ways in which electrons and\\\\n\\\\n                                                          3\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'53057fa4-ba5b-423b-a686-13c6953d5f12\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'holes hop from site to site on a semiconductor lattice (though problems of decoherence are\\\\nlikely to be relatively severe for such systems).\\\\n      It might also be possible to construct bosonic computers using photons, phonons, or\\\\natoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such systems can be highly coherent and support\\\\nnonlinear interactions: phonons and photons can interact in a nonlinear fshion via their\\\\ncommon nonlinear interaction with matter, and atoms in a Bose condensate can be made\\\\nto interact bia quantum electrodynamics (by introduction of a cavity) or by collisions. So\\\\nfar, however, the feature of Bose condensates that makes them so interesting from the point\\\\nof view of physics ‚Äî all particles in the same state ‚Äî makes them less interesting from the\\\\npoint of view of quantum computation. Many particles in the same state, which can be\\\\nmanipulated coherently by a variety of techniques, explore the same volume of Hilbert space\\\\nas a single particle in that state. As a result, it is unclear how such a bosonic system could\\\\nprovide a speed-up over conventional quantum computation. More promising than Bose\\\\ncondensates from the perspective of quantum computation and quantum communications,\\\\nis the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to ‚Äòdial up‚Äô or synthesize arbitrary states\\\\nof the cavity field. Such a use of bosonic states is important for the field of quantum\\\\ncommunications, which requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of\\\\nthe electromagnetic field.\\\\n      A third unconventional design for a quantum computer relies on ‚Äòexotic‚Äô statistics\\\\nthat are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Kitaev has recently proposed a quantum computer\\\\narchitecture based on ‚Äòanyons,‚Äô particles that when exchanged acquuire an arbitrary phase.\\\\nExamples of anyons include two-dimensional topological defects in lattice systems of spins\\\\nwith various symmetries. Kitaev noted that such anyons could perform quantum logic via\\\\nAharonov-Bohm type interactions [19]. Preskill et al. have shown explicitly how anyonic\\\\nsystems could compute in principle [20], and Lloyd et al. have proposed methods of\\\\nrealizing anyons using superconducting circuits (they could also in principle be constructed\\\\nusing NMR quantum computers to mock up the anyonic dynamics in an effectively two-\\\\ndimensional space of spins) [21]. The advantage of using anyons for quantum computation\\\\nis that their nonlocal topological nature can make them intrinsically error-correcting and\\\\nvirtually immune to the effects of noise and interference.\\\\n      As the technologies of the microscale become better developed, more and more po-\\\\ntential designs for quantum computers, both conventional and unconventional, are likely\\\\nto arise. Additional technologies that could prove useful for the construction of quantum\\\\n\\\\n                                                          4\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'de31f5a1-0290-45f3-b386-d02e3ed4c33c\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\' logic devices include photonic crystals, optical hole-burning techniques, electron spin res-\\\\n onance, quantum dots, superconducting circuits in the quantum regime, etc. Since every\\\\n quantum degree of freedom can in principle participate in a computation one cannot a\\\\n priori rule out the possibility of using currently hard to control degrees of freedom such as\\\\nquark and gluon in complex nuclei to process information. Needless to say, most if not all\\\\nof the designs inspired by these technologies are likely to fail. There is room for optimism\\\\nthat some such quantum computer designs will prove practicable, however.\\\\n      The preceding unconventional designs for quantum computers were based on existing,\\\\nexperimentally confirmed physical phenomena (except in the case of non-abelian anyons).\\\\nLet us now turn to designs based on speculative, hypothetical, and not yet verified phenom-\\\\nena. (One of the most interesting of these phenomena is large-scale quantum computation\\\\nitself: can we create and systematically transform entangled states involving hundreds or\\\\nthousands of quantum variables?) A particularly powerful hypothesis from the point of\\\\nview of quantum computation is that of nonlinear quantum mechanics.\\\\n      The conventional picture of quantum mechanics is that it is linear in the sense that the\\\\nsuperposition principle is obeyed exactly. (Of course, quantum systems can still exhibit\\\\nnonlinear interactions between degrees of freedom while continuing to obey the superpo-\\\\nsition principle.) Experiment confirms that the superposition principle is indeed obeyed\\\\nto a high degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, a number of scientists including Weinberg have\\\\nproposed nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics in which the superposition principle\\\\nis violated. Many of these proposals exhibit pathologies such as violations of the second\\\\nlaw of thermodynamics or the capacity for superluminal communication. Despite such\\\\ntheoretical difficulties, it is still possible that quantum mechanics does indeed possess a\\\\nsmall nonlinearity, even if it currently seems unlikely. If a nonlinear operation such as\\\\nthat proposed by Weinberg can be incorporated in a quantum logic operation, then the\\\\nconsequences are striking: NP-complete problems can be solved easily in polynomial time\\\\n[17]. Indeed, NP-oracle problems and all problems in #P can be solved in polynomial time\\\\non such a nonlinear quantum computer.\\\\n      A general proof of this result is given in [17], however, a simple argument for why\\\\nthis is so can be seen as follows. Suppose that it is possible to perform a non-unitary\\\\noperation on a single qubit that has a positive Lyapunov exponent over some region: i.e.,\\\\nsomewhere on the unit sphere there exists a line of finite extent along which application of\\\\nthe operation causes nearby points to move apart exponentially at a rate eŒª‚àÜŒ∏ proportional\\\\n                                                           5\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'0777fa16-f0d4-4ad9-9877-a4abca0ba70f\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'to their original angular separation Œ¥Œ∏. Now consider a function f (x) from N bits to one\\\\nbit. We wish to determine whether or not there exists an x such that f (x) = 1, and if\\\\nso, how many such x‚Äôs there are. Using the nonlinear operation with positive Lyapunov\\\\nexponent, it is straightforward to construct a mapping leaves a point on the exponentially\\\\nexpanding line (call this point |0„Äâ) fixed if their are no solutions to the equation f (x) = 1,\\\\nand that maps the point to a nearby point cos(n/2N )|0„Äâ + sin(n/2N )|1„Äâ along the line\\\\nif there are exactly n solutions to the equation f (x) = 1. Repeated application of the\\\\nnonlinear map can be used to drive the points apart at an exponentional rate: eventually,\\\\nat a time determined by the number of qubits N , the number of solutions n, and the rate\\\\nof spreading Œª, the two points will become macroscopically distinguishable, allowing one\\\\nto determine whether or not there is a solution and if there is, how many solutions there\\\\nare. The map f need only be applied once, and the amount of time it takes to reveal the\\\\nnumber of solutions is proportional to N .\\\\n      The fact that nonlinear quantum mechanics allows the straightforward solution of\\\\nNP-complete and #P problems should probably be regarded as yet another strike against\\\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. Whether or not quantum mechanics is linear is a question\\\\nto be resolved experimentally, however. In the unlikely event that quantum mechanics\\\\ndoes turn out to be nonlinear, all our problems may be solved.\\\\n      Finally, let us turn our attention to hypothetical quantum Theories of Everything,\\\\nsuch as string theory. Such a theory must clearly support quantum computation since it\\\\nsupports cavity quantum electrodynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance. The obvious\\\\nquestion to ask is then, does a Theory of Everything need to support anything more than\\\\nquantum computation? So far as experimental evidence is concerned the answer to this\\\\nquestion is apparently No: we have no evident reason to doubt that the universe is at\\\\nbottom anything more than a giant, parallel, quantum information processing machine,\\\\nand that the phenomena that we observe and attempt to characterize are simply outputs\\\\nof this machine‚Äôs ongoing computation. Of course, just how the universe is carrying out\\\\nthis computation is likely to remain a question of great interest for some time.\\\\n      To summarize: Computers are physical systems, and what they can do in practice and\\\\nin principle is circumscribed by the laws of physics. The laws of physics in turn permit a\\\\nwide variety of quantum computational devices including some based on nonconventional\\\\nstatistics and exotic effects. Modifications made to the laws of physics have the consequence\\\\nthat what can be computed in practice and in principle changes.

Quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures have in recent years\\\\n                                    proven to be a very powerful solid-state platform for quantum optics experiments. The\\\\n                                    combination of near-unity radiative coupling of a single quantum dot to a photonic\\\\n                                    mode and the ability to eliminate decoherence processes imply that an unprecedent\\\\n                                    light-matter interface can be obtained.           As a result, high-cooperativity photon-\\\\n                                    emitter quantum interfaces can be constructed opening a path-way to deterministic\\\\n                                    photonic quantum gates for quantum-information processing applications. In the\\\\n                                    present manuscript, I review current state-of-the-art on quantum dot devices and their\\\\n                                    applications for quantum technology. The overarching long-term goal of the research\\\\n                                    field is to construct photonic quantum networks where remote entanglement can be\\\\n                                    distributed over long distances by photons.\\\\n\\\\n                  1. Introduction\\\\n\\\\n                  The ultimate vision of photonic quantum technology is to construct a complex quantum\\\\n                  network of stationary quantum nodes connected by flying photons in a fully quantum\\\\n                  way, i.e.      quantum entanglement may become distributed.                          Such a new photonic\\\\n                  paradigm would have novel applications within secure quantum communication and\\\\n                  is proposed as a way of scaling up quantum computers. It is popularly referred to as the\\\\n                  ‚Äôquantum internet‚Äô [1] and has been rooted in the atomic physics community where an\\\\n                  impressive proof-of-concept elementary two-node quantum network has been achieved\\\\n                  [2]. Solid-state alternatives to atomic single-photon emitters are attractive, since unlike\\\\n                  atoms they do not require complex laser cooling and trapping techniques. On the\\\\n                  other hand solid-state systems are often considered to be ‚Äônoisy‚Äô in the sense that many\\\\n                  potential decoherence processes may deteriorate quantum properties. Remarkably, self-\\\\n                  assembled quantum dots (QDs) emitting single photons in the optical domain, notably\\\\n                  InGaAs QDs embedded in GaAs semiconductors, have matured dramatically within\\\\n                  the last few years. By systematically studying and combating the relevant decoherence\\\\n                  processes [3] impressive coherence has been demonstrated including near-perfect single-\\\\n                  photon indistinguishability (above 98%) of two subsequently emitted photons [4, 5] and\\\\n                  transform-limited emission lines [6]. Combined with the ability to dramatically enhance\\\\n                  light-matter interaction in photonic nanostructures [7], this enables near-deterministic\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'c6fdc95e-eabb-4b5e-a3c0-4c315d4c8f59\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                     2\\\\n\\\\nsingle-photon sources with an internal collection efficiency exceeding 98 % [8]. This\\\\nmajor progress entails that QD single-photon sources are now gradually outperforming\\\\nthe traditional approaches based on atoms or spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\\\\nQD sources benefit from fast operation speeds, excellent stability and brightness, as well\\\\nas the potential scalability to multiple single photons and emitters. Notably, a number of\\\\nimpressive experiments have recently been implemented with QDs that have not been\\\\naccomplished on other platforms. They include the experimental demonstration of a\\\\ndeterministic entangled cluster state of strings of photons [9], boson sampling with so far\\\\nfive photons [10], the detection of squeezed light correlations in resonance fluorescence\\\\n[11], and the demonstration of an on-demand entangled photon source with higher\\\\nthan 90% fidelity [12]. Time is now to build on these and other achievements in order\\\\nto scale QD photonic quantum technology and construct large and complex quantum\\\\narchitectures for quantum-information processing applications.\\\\n      The present manuscript reviews the current state-of-the-art on quantum photonics\\\\nbased on QD photon emitters towards the overarching goal of constructing photonic\\\\nquantum networks.              At present, a number of basic functionalities have been\\\\nsuccessfully demonstrated with generally impressive performance. These may constitute\\\\nfundamental building blocks of photonic quantum networks. In that sense a current\\\\nmajor challenge for theoretical quantum physicist is to develop resource efficient\\\\narchitectures tailored to the specific quantum hardware available, i.e., addressing how\\\\nthe basic ‚Äôpuzzle pieces‚Äô can be combined. Figure 1 illustrates the ‚Äôpuzzle pieces‚Äô already\\\\nbeing developed for the QD platform, and that will be considered here. They include\\\\nsingle-photon sources, single-photon nonlinearity, photonic circuitry, efficient-coupling\\\\nto optical fibers, on-chip single-photon detectors, and multi-emitter coupling.\\\\n      QDs enable two different types of quantum resources: they may be employed\\\\nas a source of single photons or alternatively a single spin trapped in a QD may be\\\\nmanipulated as a qubit. Figure 2 illustrates these two approaches. In the former case a\\\\nsingle electron-hole pair is created in a QD by either optical excitation or by controllably\\\\ntunneling carriers into the QD with the application of an electric field. The electron-\\\\nhole pair subsequently recombines whereby a single photon is emitted by spontaneous\\\\nemission within a lifetime of typically 1 ns for a QD in a bulk medium. In the latter\\\\napproach a single carrier (electron or hole) is prepared in the QD by tunneling. The\\\\ncarrier spin is coupled to light since a photon may subsequently be absorbed by the QD\\\\ncreating a negatively (positively) charged exciton for the case of an initial electron (hole).\\\\nDepending on the operational condition, the spin may have a coherence time of up to\\\\n1 Œºs (for holes) [13, 14], which means that in principle many quantum operations can\\\\nbe carried out with fast optical control techniques before decoherence sets in. For some\\\\nquantum-information applications, however, longer spin coherence times are required,\\\\ne.g., in matter based quantum-repeater architectures. To this end, the QD platform\\\\nmust be interfaced with long-lived quantum memories based on, e.g., defect centers\\\\nin diamond or atomic ensembles [15]. Such hybrid quantum network architectures are\\\\noutside the scope of the present Review.\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'a19b0d3b-ebad-4d36-a615-6a4ee63a39ad\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                                   3\\\\n                                                                    ~l ~\\\\n                                                                    Nonlinearity             Processing\\\\n                                                                                                  wn\\\\n      Fiber         Out-coupling           Single photons            Detection          Dipole-dipole interaction\\\\nFigure 1: Illustration of basic functionalities that can be implemented with QDs and\\\\nphotonic nanostructures.

Single-photon sources\\\\n\\\\nA QD efficiently coupled to a nanophotonic cavity or waveguide offers a promising\\\\nroute towards a deterministic single-photon source. Early pioneering work showed that\\\\nPurcell enhancement in an optical cavity may be employed to both improve brightness\\\\nand coherence of the source [16]. Ideally a useful single-photon source emits an optical\\\\npulse containing a single photon in a useful optical mode (e.g., into an optical fiber)\\\\nevery time the QD is triggered by either an optical or electrical pulse. Furthermore,\\\\nmost applications in quantum-information processing require that the emitted photons\\\\nare fully coherent, which entails that decoherence processes occurring on a time scale\\\\nof the radiative decay of the QD must be eliminated. Thus, three major figures-of-\\\\nmerit need to be optimized: i) the single-photon purity, ii) the single-photon coupling\\\\nefficiency, and iii) the indistinguishability of the emitted photons.\\\\n      Re i): The discrete level structure of self-assembled QDs having widely separated\\\\noptical transitions implies that they are capable of emitting high-purity single photons\\\\n[17]. This is gauged in a Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) correlation experiment by\\\\nrecording the multi-photon emission probability. By using samples with a low QD\\\\ndensity and implementing (quasi)-resonant excitation to selectively excite only a single\\\\nQD, excellent single-photon purity can be obtained at the level of g(2)(0) ‚â§ 0.1%, cf.\\\\nFig. 3.\\\\n      Re ii): The overall coupling efficiency determines the brightness of the single-photon\\\\nsource and is comprised of several factors [7]: the excitation and single-photon emission\\\\nprobability of the QD, the efficiency with which the emitted photons are channeled to a\\\\nsingle mode (the Œ≤-factor), and the transfer efficiency to a low-loss propagating mode,\\\\ne.g., an optical fiber. Significant progress has been reported on all three engineering\\\\ntasks: resonant œÄ-pulse excitation allows deterministically preparing a single exciton in\\\\na QD [18] and electrically gated structures eliminate blinking between different exciton\\\\ncomplexes [19]. Embedding QDs in photonic nanostructures allows reaching a near-\\\\nunity Œ≤-factor, which has been obtained in nanophotonic waveguides [8, 20] and cavities\\\\n[4]. Finally, a variety of approaches and designs can be implemented for transferring\\\\nthe collected photons to an optical fiber using, e.g., tailored gratings for coupling light\\\\nguided on planar structures vertically off the chip, or waveguide taper sections designed\\\\nto couple directly to a fiber either by direct or evanescent coupling [21, 22, 23].\\\\n      Re iii): The indistinguishability of an emitted photon is determined by the amount\\\\nof decoherence taking place within the emitter decay time. With a typical decay time\\\\nof nanoseconds, the primary decoherence source is coupling of the QD to phonons\\\\nand potentially photon jitter induced by relaxation processes originating from non-\\\\nresonant excitation schemes [24].               The latter may be overcome by strict resonant\\\\nexcitation.      Phonon interactions at the contrary are unavoidable and lead to two\\\\neffects: wide phonon sidebands and residual broadening of the zero-phonon line. The\\\\nformer contribution (containing typically about 10 % of the the total emission at\\\\nlow temperatures [7]) can readily be filtered away either by an external filter thereby\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'de71718d-112b-478e-b755-5c7d40825e52\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                  5\\\\n\\\\nreducing the overall efficiency or more favorably by implementing narrow-band Purcell\\\\nenhancement. Hence the broadening of the zero-phonon line remains the fundamental\\\\ndecoherence mechanism. An in-depth theoretical study of this process including the\\\\nrole of the dimensionality of the photonic nanostructure can be found in Ref. [25].\\\\nImportantly a clear route to indistinguishable photons with near-unity visibility can be\\\\nlaid out, which has also been confirmed experimentally [4, 5, 26].\\\\n     The previous discussion illustrates that QDs are capable of producing a truly on-\\\\ndemand source of single photons by implementing, in a single device, the functionalities\\\\ndemonstrated so far only in different experiments. It is likely that such a source will\\\\nbe developed experimentally soon. In particular, it is remarkable that decoherence\\\\nprocesses can be overcome in a solid-state system to such an extent that near-unity\\\\nindistinguishability between subsequently emitted photons from the same QD can be\\\\nobtained. Next step is to convert a single QD source generating photons as ‚Äùpearls\\\\non a string‚Äù into a de-multiplexed source delivering many identical single photons\\\\nsimultaneously in individual modes. Such a source can be constructed by cascading\\\\nelectro-optical switches and coupling the photons into different optical fibers in order\\\\nto overcome the time delay between subsequently emitted photons, cf. Fig. 4(a).\\\\nTo this end, the demonstration of near-transform-limited QD emission lines [6] has\\\\nthe remarkable consequence that a single QD can emit thousands of indistinguishable\\\\nphotons thereby providing a huge quantum resource. Indeed recent demonstration of\\\\nindistinguishability exceeding 90 % between two photons separated by more than 1000\\\\nemission events has proven this explicitly [27].\\\\n\\\\n3. Integrated quantum photonics\\\\n\\\\nAs detailed in the previous section, currently the most reliable approach to generate\\\\nmultiple single photons utilizes a single integrated QD source where the photons\\\\nare coupled off-chip to an optical fiber, and highly-efficient bulk optical components\\\\nimplemented for switching and routing, cf. Fig. 4(a). Nonetheless, the potential benefits\\\\nof integrating functionalities on-chip are many in terms of stability, ease of operation,\\\\nlow loss, and speed [28].           Figure 4(b) shows an architecture for an integrated de-\\\\nmultiplexed source of single photons based on a single QD in a planar nanophotonic\\\\nwaveguide platform.          To implement this scheme requires the development of high-\\\\nefficiency and fast switches, and multi-port waveguide-fiber interfaces. The former\\\\nrequires the development of new devices and functionalities on-chip where so-far the\\\\nmost common approach for reconfigurable circuitry has been the application of thermo-\\\\noptic phase shifters [29]. De-multiplexing requires fast switches, and two promising\\\\napproaches include electro-optical modulation implemented directly in the host material\\\\nof the QD (i.e. GaAs) [30, 31] or electro-mechanical coupling [32].\\\\n     The crucial parameter determining the size of the photonic resource that can be\\\\ngenerated with a de-multiplexed single-photon source is the overall efficiency, including\\\\nswitching, propagation, and coupling efficiencies.

Another\\\\nimportant task is to develop complex integrated tunable photonic circuits that can\\\\nprocess the generated single photons leading to applications for quantum simulations\\\\n[33]. Current state-of-the-art of this technology is a six-mode reprogrammable circuit\\\\ncapable of implementing universal high-fidelity quantum gates [29]. Considerable effort\\\\nis directed to the scaling of these circuits in working towards a fully integrated system\\\\nwhere photon source and processing circuit would be implemented on a single photonic\\\\nchip. However, implementing on-chip the relatively long optical delays (typically tens of\\\\nnanoseconds) required to interfere subsequently emitted photons, poses a challenge for\\\\nthis approach in requiring slow-light optical buffers. Consequently at present it seems\\\\nmost realistic to consider approaches based on two separate chips, connected by optical\\\\nfibers, where one chip constitutes the source and the other chip the quantum processor.\\\\n      The operation wavelength of a quantum photonics processor is an essential\\\\nparameter. The preferred operation wavelength is within the telecom C-band (1.55 Œºm),\\\\nwhere advanced high-performance optical components and fiber technology developed\\\\nfor telecom industry are present. The natural emission wavelength of self-assembled high\\\\nquality QDs is around 950 nm and while significant efforts are taken to develop QDs in\\\\nthe telecom bands as well [34, 35] the excellent performance in terms of coherence and\\\\nefficiency required for quantum technology has not yet been achieved.

Noise free conversion of single photons from a QD with an\\\\nefficiency exceeding 30% has been demonstrated [36], which could be further increased by\\\\nimproving the in- and out-coupling efficiency through the nonlinear conversion crystal.\\\\nThe two-chip approach alluded to above has the asset that the frequency conversion\\\\nstep could naturally be incorporated in between the source chip and the processing\\\\nchip. Furthermore, implementing frequency conversion of QD photons also has another\\\\nadvantage, since it provides a way of overcoming spectral inhomogeneities of photons\\\\nemitted by different QDs by transducing them to the same wavelength in the C-band\\\\nwith the implementation of a tunable pump laser. This could prove a powerful way of\\\\nscaling up QD systems to couple multiple emitter qubits (e.g., spins) in addition to the\\\\nmultiple photon qubits already considered.\\\\n      Finally, another essential requirement is the ability to detect optical photons with\\\\nvery high efficiency. Very significant progress has been obtained in recent years with the\\\\ndevelopment of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors [37], where the single-\\\\nphoton detection efficiency today approaches 100% and the speed is compatible with QD\\\\nsources. Importantly these detectors can naturally be integrated on the planar GaAs\\\\nplatform containing QDs [38], which means that photon source, circuit, and detection\\\\ncould potentially be integrated on a single chip, which may pave the way to ultimately\\\\nlow-loss photonic quantum nodes.\\\\n\\\\n4. Single-photon nonlinearity\\\\n\\\\nThe previous sections concerned the generation of single photons and their subsequent\\\\nquantum interference in photonic circuits. Many quantum-information applications\\\\nof photons require generating photon-photon interactions. Generally photons interact\\\\nweakly meaning that standard nonlinearities are typically too weak to be operational\\\\nat the level of single photons. However, the efficient coupling of single QDs to photonic\\\\nnanostructures imply that such a system may be exploited to mediate a giant nonlinear\\\\nresponse operational at the level of single photons. Two different approaches can be\\\\ntaken to reach a giant nonlinearity with a QD or any other quantum emitter: the QD\\\\ncan be strongly coupled to a cavity and the nonlinearity of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder\\\\nexploited [39, 40], or a QD very efficiently coupled to a single optical mode in a cavity\\\\n[41, 42] or waveguide [43] may be used as a saturable nonlinearity. The latter approach\\\\nis beneficial for ease of operation, since it is less sensitive to the exact tuning of the\\\\nwavelength of the QD. Furthermore, the saturable QD nonlinearity generally can be\\\\noperated at a weaker incident photon flux [43]. The key operational principle of the QD\\\\nnonlinearity is as follows: a narrow-band pulse containing a single photon is reflected\\\\nfrom a QD in a waveguide due to destructive interference of forward scattering and the\\\\nincoming field. The efficient coupling (high Œ≤-factor) and coherent interaction, which\\\\ncan be achieved with QDs, implies that the interaction between the photon and the\\\\nQD is deterministic.

From an experimental point of view this type of nonlinearity\\\\nis attractive since no active control over the quantum state of the QD is required,\\\\ni.e., the QD is merely exploited as a passive scatterer. On the other hand, the photon\\\\nsorting is not ideal even for a perfect coupling efficiency. This implies that while a single-\\\\nphoton component of a pulse may be deterministically reflected, two- and higher-photon\\\\ncomponents are only partially transmitted and in this process entanglement is generated\\\\nbetween the two photons [44]. One approach of overcoming this limitation and obtain\\\\ndeterministic photon sorting has been suggested by combining the QD nonlinearity with\\\\na nonlinear spatio-temporal mode selector [45]. Such an approach may be applied for\\\\nconstructing a resource-efficient Bell-state analyzer [44, 45], cf. Section 7. It should be\\\\nmentioned that having a three-level emitter with coherent control of the level populations\\\\nin the waveguide opens a range of additional opportunities. Such level schemes can be\\\\nimplemented with charged QDs, cf. the description in the next section. One exciting\\\\nproposal is that of a photonic transistor controlled by only a single photon [46].\\\\n\\\\n5. Spin-photon interfaces\\\\n\\\\nIntroducing a single spin in a QD leads to a range of additional opportunities. It grants\\\\naccess to two separate ground states (spin up or down) that can be exploited as a\\\\nquantum memory to encode a qubit. Either single holes or electrons can be employed\\\\nand may be deterministically prepared by controlling the tunnel barriers in electrically\\\\ncontacted semiconductor structures. Various level structures can be implemented by the\\\\nuse of Zeeman tuning with a magnetic field, and spin initialization, manipulation, and\\\\nread-out can be achieved rapidly with short optical pulses (typically in the nanosecond\\\\nrange), cf.      Ref.    [19] for a detailed review of the physics of single spins in QDs.\\\\nThe spin lifetime can be in the range of milliseconds or longer in a large magnetic\\\\nfield, which is determined by phonon-mediated spin relaxation processes. However,\\\\nin quantum applications the coherence time of the spin is the essential parameter.\\\\nA coherence time of up to T 2‚àó > 460 ns has been reported for hole spins that has\\\\nthe advantage compared to electrons that they do not suffer from the Fermi contact\\\\nhyperfine interaction with nuclear spins [14]. Importantly the spin coherence time can\\\\nbe several orders of magnitude longer than the spin manipulation time, which means\\\\nthat multiple quantum gate operations could be implemented within the spin coherence\\\\ntime. Unravelling spin decoherence mechanisms in QDs is a research topic in itself and is\\\\noutside the scope of the present review. For a thorough discussion, see Refs. [19, 47]. It\\\\nis anticipated that further research efforts will enable increasing the spin coherence time\\\\nfurther. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that it will be possible to extend the coherence\\\\ntime by many orders of magnitude in present QD systems. In particular, long-range\\\\nquantum repeater protocols would require millisecond range quantum memories. This\\\\nentails a hybrid approach where the single photons generated by QDs are interfaced\\\\nwith long-lived quantum memories, e.g., vacancy centers in diamond [48], ions [49], or\\', \\'text_template\\': \\'{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\'}, {\\'class_name\\': \\'Document\\', \\'doc_id\\': \\'093afd39-07a0-4589-a0c9-eb679ce77c2f\\', \\'embedding\\': None, \\'end_char_idx\\': None, \\'excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\': [], \\'extra_info\\': {\\'file_name\\': \\'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks\\'}, \\'metadata_seperator\\': \\'\\\\n\\', \\'metadata_template\\': \\'{key}: {value}\\', \\'mimetype\\': \\'text/plain\\', \\'relationships\\': {}, \\'start_char_idx\\': None, \\'text\\': \\' Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                 10\\\\n\\\\n potentially mechanical systems.\\\\n      Considering a charged exciton in an external magnetic field, various four-level\\\\n emitter schemes can be engineered with two ground states corresponding to either\\\\n (pseudo)spin up or down of the electron (hole). The recombination of a charged exciton\\\\n leads to the emission of polarized photons, where the polarization of the photon is\\\\n correlated with the resulting spin state. In this way entanglement between the QD\\\\n spin and the polarization of the emitted photon can be generated [13, 50] where\\\\n in general hyper-entanglement between spin, polarization, and frequency is obtained.\\\\n Subsequently the information in one of the variables can be erased to create a Bell state.\\\\n This has been the resource enabling quantum teleportation between a single photon and\\\\n a solid-state spin [51]. A further extension of this experiment was the demonstration of\\\\n heralded entanglement between two spatially separate hole spins in QDs [52], cf. Fig. 5\\\\n for the experimental layout.\\\\n      Another possibility is to couple QD spins directly to photon path by exploiting\\\\n the concept of chiral light-matter interaction [53]. By tailoring the local electric field\\\\n in a nanophotonic waveguide to match the in-plane circular dipole moment of one of\\\\n the charged exciton transitions, it is possible to induce deterministic directional photon\\\\n emission [54], i.e. œÉ¬± transitions emit in different directions. This effect was used\\\\nto demonstrate an interface between QD spin and the photon path [55]. Based on\\\\nthis functionality a photonic quantum network architecture was put forward and its\\\\nfeasibility evaluated for QDs in nanophotonic waveguides [56], cf. Fig. 5.\\\\n\\\\n6. Coupling of multiple quantum dots\\\\n\\\\nWe have seen in previous sections how a single QD deterministically coupled to a single\\\\noptical mode may be exploited as a source of multiple photonic qubits potentially\\\\ngenerating a large quantum resource. It is natural to consider the option of scaling\\\\nfurther up by coupling multiple QDs. This is generally a demanding task, as it is\\\\nthe case for any solid-state optical emitter, since inhomogeneous broadening of a QD\\\\nensemble (typically at the level of THz, which should be compared to the sub-GHz\\\\nhomogenous linewidth of a QD) implies that significant spectral mismatch would need\\\\nto be overcome. Various tuning methods of QDs have been implemented including\\\\nelectric-field tuning [57] and strain tuning [58] that needs to be implemented locally to\\\\neach individual QD. Eventually not only the central emission frequency of the different\\\\nemitters must be controlled, but the complete photon pulses need to be matched in\\\\norder to faithfully couple multiple QDs. An important figure-of-merit of the success is\\\\ngauged in a quantum-interference experiment between two separate QD single-photon\\\\nsources, where an interference visibility of 93% has been reported in a weak-excitation\\\\nregime [59], which is a highly encouragin result for this approach.\\\\n      Given the ability to radiatively couple two or more QDs, a photonic nanostructure\\\\ncan be constructed to enhance and tailor the coupling.

Quantum network architectures\\\\n\\\\nWe have reviewed various basic quantum functionalities and hardware that can be\\\\nimplemented with the use of QDs embedded in modern nanophotonic structures. It\\\\nis a pertinent task, to consider what applications and actual architectures can be\\\\nimplemented with these quantum resources and how to make them most resource\\\\nefficient. This section briefly highlights some of the opportunities and future directions.\\\\nA general observation, as discussed in detail above, is that QD systems can generate\\\\nmany single-photon qubits, while the scaling up to many matter qubits is expected to\\\\nbe much more challenging. It is important to have these general guidelines in mind\\\\nwhen designing resource efficient quantum network architectures that is tailored to the\\\\nquantum hardware based on QDs.\\\\n     As discussed in the present Review, QDs in nanophotonic structures are very well\\\\nsuited for generating highly coherent single photons on demand at a high repetition\\\\nrate. Such a source can generate thousands of indistinguishable photons [27] that if\\\\nefficiently routed could be an important photonic resource for quantum simulations [33].\\\\nFurthermore, recent developments on how to efficiently fuse photonic qubits with linear\\\\noptics have the renewed excitement on how to construct single-photon based quantum\\\\ncomputing [63].\\\\n     Introducing a single-photon nonlinearity to the toolbox opens for a range of\\\\nadditional possibilities. The most simple case is that of a two-level emitter, and here\\\\ndistortion of the optical pulses associated with photon-emitter bound state contributions\\\\nhas been interpreted as essentially a ‚Äùno-go theorem‚Äù for quantum computation [64].\\\\nOne work around, however, has been identified where the pulse distortion is actually\\\\nexploited such that one- and two-photon pulses are scattered into orthogonal spectral-\\\\ntemporal modes that can subsequently be separated, e.g., by nonlinear frequency\\\\nconversion [45]. With such a functionality all path-encoded photonic Bell states can\\\\nbe deterministically measured exploiting only four non-linear interaction process, linear\\\\noptics, and photon detection, cf. Fig. 6. Based on a Bell-state analyzer, quantum\\\\ncomputing can in principle be implemented by teleportation based gates and linear\\\\noptical quantum computing [65]. Alternatively, a photonic CZ gate can be directly\\\\nbased on the two-level emitter nonlinearity. However, in this case the pulse distortion\\\\nintroduced by photon scattering has to be undone by scattering an additional time on\\\\nthe emitter. However, since this scattering process is not time symmetric the photon\\\\npulse would need to be reverted in time in between the two scattering process. Such a\\\\ntime reversal of the photon pulses could in principle be obtained by storing, reverting,\\\\nand releasing photon pulses in a gradient-echo quantum memory.\\\\n     Having access to a 3-level Œõ-scheme with two stable ground states leads to many\\\\nmore opportunities since now the emitter can store a qubit for extended times. Coherent\\\\ncontrol of the qubit state enables implementing a Duan-Kimble CNOT gate for photons\\\\nwhere two subsequently interacting photons are entangled by their successive interaction\\\\nwith the same emitter [66].

The general philosophy behind such one-way quantum\\\\ncomputing architectures [70] is that a large scale entangled state is generated ‚Äùup front‚Äù\\\\nand computation carried out by single-qubit operations induced by measurements.\\\\nImportantly, quantum computing requires access to 2D photonic cluster states as\\\\nopposed to the 1D cluster states considered above.                       Several proposals of how to\\\\nachieve this with QDs have been put forward. One approach is to optically couple\\\\ntwo QDs [71], which requires local tuning of the two QDs into mutual resonance. An\\\\nalternative proposal has been put forward based on a single quantum emitter, where the\\\\nemitted photons are controllably coupled back to interact with the emitter and through\\\\nthis process generates the 2D cluster [72]. Such a ‚Äùone-emitter quantum-computer\\\\narchitecture‚Äù is almost ideally suited for implementation based on QDs in nanophotonic\\\\nstructures. Another exciting potential applications of photonic cluster states would be in\\\\nquantum repeater protocols without the necessity of a matter-based quantum memory\\\\n[73, 74]. Such an approach would potentially overcome the main bottleneck of the QD\\\\nbased platform for quantum networks resulting from the relatively short-lived quantum\\\\nmemory offered by the QD spin.\\\\n\\\\n8. Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nQDs in photonic nanostructures constitute an unprecedent photon-emitter interface at\\\\noptical frequencies. The recent significant progress implies that advanced quantum-\\\\ninformation processing protocols now become within experimental reach in the overall\\\\nquest towards constructing photonic quantum networks. Such a distributed photonic\\\\nquantum network would open new avenues for secure quantum communication and\\\\nultimately provide a way of scaling up quantum computers.

So far, a number of experimental tests of quantum non-locality based\\\\n                                     on Bell‚Äôs theorem [1] have been carried out [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In these experiments\\\\n                                     entangled photon pairs are produced, and the polarization correlation between\\\\n                                     entangled photon pairs is measured. Experimental results obtained in these tests\\\\n                                     are in favor for quantum non-locality. Although it has been pointed out that\\\\n                                     this polarization correlation is compatible with local realism [7], these results\\\\n                                     are generally considered as direct evidences for the existence of quantum non-\\\\n                                     locality, and more experiments [8, 9, 10] showing different kind of quantum\\\\n                                     non-local correlation are carried out. The entangled photon pairs are used as\\\\n                                     light source in these experiments, and the interpretation of the experimental\\\\n                                     results as proofs for quantum non-locality is closely related to the assumption\\\\n                                     that these photon pairs are in entangled quantum state.\\\\n                                          In this letter, I will show that the same polarization correlation also exists\\\\n                                     for certain un-entangled photon pairs. And on other hand, based on the consid-\\\\n                                     eration of momentum conservation, I will also show that the entangled quantum\\\\n                                     state is not a correct description for photon pairs used in these experimental\\\\n                                     tests of quantum non-locality.

The energy and the momentum\\\\nof a photon pair in the state |œàe„Äâ is equal to the energy and the momentum of\\\\nthe incident photon from which the photon pair is generated. But there is\\\\na problem in this argument, namely the parametric down conversion process\\\\ntakes place in nonlinear optical crystals, so one must take the photons and the\\\\ncrystal as one single system when the condition of the energy and the momen-\\\\ntum conservation is applied. The macroscopic properties of nonlinear optical\\\\ncrystals do not change in the parametric down conversion process. Thus the\\\\nexpectation values of the energy and the momentum of crystals are the same\\\\nbefore and after the photon pairs‚Äô generation. Therefore the expectation val-\\\\nues of energy and momentum of a photon pair must equal to the expectation\\\\nvalues of energy and momentum of incident photon. This condition is satisfied\\\\nby the quantum state |œàe„Äâ. On other hand, photons are coupled with optical\\\\nphonons with same momentum when passing through crystals, and there exist\\\\nexchanges of energy and momentum between photons and crystals through the\\\\nphoton-phonon interaction during photons‚Äô propagation in crystals. One may\\\\nneglect the energy exchange between photons and crystals because the ener-\\\\ngies of phonons are much smaller than that of photons with same momentum,\\\\nbut the momentum exchange between photons and crystals must be taken into\\\\nconsideration. This exchange of momentum causes fluctuations in momenta of\\\\ncrystals and generated photon pairs.

An experimental test on the possibility of\\\\ndetecting both of the photons in one single channel can be done by using an\\\\nexperimental setup shown in FIG. 2. This setup is quite similar to that used\\\\nfor tests of quantum non-locality based on Bell‚Äôs theorem. But a half reflecting\\\\nmirror is inserted now into the channel 2 to split it into the channels 3 and 4,\\\\nand the coincidence counting rate between the channels 3 and 4 is measured.\\\\nThis coincidence counting rate is proportional to the polarization correlation\\\\nbetween photons in the channel 3 and in the channel 4. An anti-coincidence\\\\ncondition with the signal from the channel 1 can also be applied to ensure that\\\\nthis coincidence counting rate is not from other sources. By using the expres-\\\\nsions (15), (16), (13) and (14), one can easily verify that the following relation\\\\nholds for this coincidence counting rate\\\\n                                C(Œ∏3, Œ∏4) = CMcos2(Œ∏3 ‚àí Œ∏4),‚Ä≤‚Ä≤                      (24)\\\\nif the photon pairs are in the quantum state |œàu„Äâ, and\\\\n\\\\n                                           C(Œ∏3, Œ∏4) ‚â° 0,                           (25)\\\\nif the photon pairs are in the quantum state |œàe„Äâ.\\\\n     The coherence of photons in different channels can also be used for testing\\\\nthe quantum state of ‚Äúentangled‚Äù photon pairs.

But till\\\\nnow, such a contradiction did not occur, because no particle pairs in entangled\\\\nquantum states had been produced. Can particle pairs in entangled quantum\\\\nstates be generated ever? It is most likely not. Due to the interaction with\\\\nthe source of particle pairs, it should be impossible for the produced particle\\\\npair with different momenta to be in a quantum state with well defined mo-\\\\nmentum, such as the entangled quantum state. This observation is consistent\\\\nwith Santos‚Äôs suggestion [7] that only quantum states which do not contradict\\\\nwith locality requirement are physical states. From this point of view, the EPR\\\\nparadox is just a spectacular illustration of the restriction on quantum states\\\\nimposed by locality requirement.\\\\n\\\\nReferences\\\\n[1] J. S.

When scientific progress augments or revises those laws, our picture of what\\n                 computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is generally accepted as the\\n                 fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behave. Quantum computers can\\n                 in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computational tasks that classical com-\\n                 puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should turn out to be incomplete\\n                 or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will change. In addition, the set\\n                 of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essentially any coherent quantum\\n                 phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom can\\n                 in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This paper discusses how the revi-\\n                 sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phenomena can lead to new\\n                 technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.\\n                      Since new quantum effects are discovered seemingly every day, let‚Äôs first discuss two\\n                 basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum\\n                 computation. These are 1) The phenomenon must be nonlinear, and 2) It must be coherent.\\n                 To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some form of nonlinearity, e.g.,\\n                 a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom. Without such a nonlinearity\\n                 quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot perform even so simple a nonlinear\\n                 operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisite for performing tasks\\n                 such as factoring using Shor‚Äôs algorithm [10], quantum simulation a la Feynman [11] and\\n                 Lloyd [12], or Grover‚Äôs data-base search algorithm [13], all of which require extended\\n                 manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.\\n\\n                                                                        1', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '066b2185-7165-468b-84f7-b8866f9baa4f', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '      The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-\\nnomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in principle sufficient. As shown\\nin [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-\\nfices to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be assembled into a quantum\\ncomputer. In addition, the work of Preskill et al. [18] on robust quantum computation\\nshows that an error rate of no more than 10‚àí4 per quantum logic operation allows one to\\nperform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principle.\\n      In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are likely to prove sufficiently\\ncontrollable to provide extended quantum computation. Promising devices under current\\nexperimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high finesse cavities for manipulating\\nlight and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and molecular systems that can be\\nmade to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Such devices store quantum\\ninformation on the states of quantum systems such as photons, atoms, or nuclei, and\\naccomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the\\napplication of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser fields. We will call such\\ndevices ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been\\nconstructed.\\n      There is another sense in which such computers are conventional: although the de-\\nvices described above have already been used to explore new regimes in physics and to\\ncreate and investigate the properties of new and exotic quantum states of matter, they\\nfunction according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the\\nmost striking examples of the ‚Äòconventionality‚Äô of current quantum logic devices are NMR\\nquantum microprocessors that are operated using techniques that have been refined for\\nalmost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though\\ncertainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electrodynamic regime where the\\nfundamental physics has been understood for decades (that is not to say that new and\\nunexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime, rather that there is general\\nagreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).\\n      Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic device is the best kind of\\nquantum logic device to have around. It is exactly because the physics of nuclear magnetic\\nresonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this\\nphysics can be used systematically to construct and manipulate the exotic quantum states\\nthat form the basis for quantum computation. With that recognition, let us turn to\\n\\n                                                         2', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'bcf5f805-d98f-4076-aa8c-f753cf7dbfa1', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '‚Äòunconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n      Perhaps the most obvious basis for an unconventional quantum computer is the use\\nof particles with non-Boltzmann statistics in a refime where these statistics play a key role\\nin the dynamics of the device. For example, Lloyd [16] has proposed the use of fermions\\nas the fundamental carriers of quantum information, so that a site or state occupied by a\\nfermion represents a 1 and an unoccupied site or state represents a 0. It is straightforward\\nto design a universal quantum computer using a conditional hopping dynamics on an array\\nof sites, in which a fermion hops from one site to another if only if other sites are occupied.\\n      If the array is one-dimensional, then such a fermionic quantum computer is equivalent\\nto a conventional quantum computer via the well-known technique of bosonization. If the\\narray is two or more dimensional, however, a local operation involving fermions on the\\nlattice cannot be mocked up by a local operation on a conventional quantum computer,\\nwhich must explicitly keep track of the phases induced by Fermi statistics. As a result,\\nsuch a fermionic computer can perform certain operations more rapidly than a conventional\\nquantum computer. An obvious example of a problem that can be solved more rapidly on\\na fermionic quantum computer is the problem of simulating a lattice fermionic system in\\ntwo or more dimensions. To get the antisymmetrization right in second quantized form,\\na conventional ‚ÄòBoltzmann‚Äô quantum computer takes time proportional to T ‚Ñìd‚àí1 where T\\nis the time over which the simulation is to take place, ‚Ñì is the length of the lattice and\\nd is the dimension, while a fermionic quantum computer takes time proportional to T .\\n(Here we assume that the computations for both conventional and Fermionic quantum\\ncomputers can take advantage of the intrinsic parallelizability of such simulations: if the\\ncomputations are performed serially an additional factro of ‚Ñìd is required for both types\\nof computer to update each site sequentially.)\\n      As the lattice size ‚Ñì and the dimension d grow large, the difference between the two\\ntypes of computer also grows large. Indeed, the problem of simulating fermions hopping\\non a hypercube of dimension d as d ‚Üí ‚àû is evidently exponentially harder on a con-\\nventional quantum computer than a Fermionic quantum computer. Since a variety of\\ndifficult problems such as the travelling-salesman problem and data-base search problem\\ncan be mapped to particles hopping on a hypercube, it is interesting to speculate whether\\nfermionic computers might provide an exponential speed-up on problems of interest in ad-\\ndition to quantum simulation. No such problems are currently known, however. Fermionic\\ncomputers could be realized in principle by manipulating the ways in which electrons and\\n\\n                                                          3', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '53057fa4-ba5b-423b-a686-13c6953d5f12', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'holes hop from site to site on a semiconductor lattice (though problems of decoherence are\\nlikely to be relatively severe for such systems).\\n      It might also be possible to construct bosonic computers using photons, phonons, or\\natoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such systems can be highly coherent and support\\nnonlinear interactions: phonons and photons can interact in a nonlinear fshion via their\\ncommon nonlinear interaction with matter, and atoms in a Bose condensate can be made\\nto interact bia quantum electrodynamics (by introduction of a cavity) or by collisions. So\\nfar, however, the feature of Bose condensates that makes them so interesting from the point\\nof view of physics ‚Äî all particles in the same state ‚Äî makes them less interesting from the\\npoint of view of quantum computation. Many particles in the same state, which can be\\nmanipulated coherently by a variety of techniques, explore the same volume of Hilbert space\\nas a single particle in that state. As a result, it is unclear how such a bosonic system could\\nprovide a speed-up over conventional quantum computation. More promising than Bose\\ncondensates from the perspective of quantum computation and quantum communications,\\nis the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to ‚Äòdial up‚Äô or synthesize arbitrary states\\nof the cavity field. Such a use of bosonic states is important for the field of quantum\\ncommunications, which requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of\\nthe electromagnetic field.\\n      A third unconventional design for a quantum computer relies on ‚Äòexotic‚Äô statistics\\nthat are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Kitaev has recently proposed a quantum computer\\narchitecture based on ‚Äòanyons,‚Äô particles that when exchanged acquuire an arbitrary phase.\\nExamples of anyons include two-dimensional topological defects in lattice systems of spins\\nwith various symmetries. Kitaev noted that such anyons could perform quantum logic via\\nAharonov-Bohm type interactions [19]. Preskill et al. have shown explicitly how anyonic\\nsystems could compute in principle [20], and Lloyd et al. have proposed methods of\\nrealizing anyons using superconducting circuits (they could also in principle be constructed\\nusing NMR quantum computers to mock up the anyonic dynamics in an effectively two-\\ndimensional space of spins) [21]. The advantage of using anyons for quantum computation\\nis that their nonlocal topological nature can make them intrinsically error-correcting and\\nvirtually immune to the effects of noise and interference.\\n      As the technologies of the microscale become better developed, more and more po-\\ntential designs for quantum computers, both conventional and unconventional, are likely\\nto arise. Additional technologies that could prove useful for the construction of quantum\\n\\n                                                          4', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'de31f5a1-0290-45f3-b386-d02e3ed4c33c', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': ' logic devices include photonic crystals, optical hole-burning techniques, electron spin res-\\n onance, quantum dots, superconducting circuits in the quantum regime, etc. Since every\\n quantum degree of freedom can in principle participate in a computation one cannot a\\n priori rule out the possibility of using currently hard to control degrees of freedom such as\\nquark and gluon in complex nuclei to process information. Needless to say, most if not all\\nof the designs inspired by these technologies are likely to fail. There is room for optimism\\nthat some such quantum computer designs will prove practicable, however.\\n      The preceding unconventional designs for quantum computers were based on existing,\\nexperimentally confirmed physical phenomena (except in the case of non-abelian anyons).\\nLet us now turn to designs based on speculative, hypothetical, and not yet verified phenom-\\nena. (One of the most interesting of these phenomena is large-scale quantum computation\\nitself: can we create and systematically transform entangled states involving hundreds or\\nthousands of quantum variables?) A particularly powerful hypothesis from the point of\\nview of quantum computation is that of nonlinear quantum mechanics.\\n      The conventional picture of quantum mechanics is that it is linear in the sense that the\\nsuperposition principle is obeyed exactly. (Of course, quantum systems can still exhibit\\nnonlinear interactions between degrees of freedom while continuing to obey the superpo-\\nsition principle.) Experiment confirms that the superposition principle is indeed obeyed\\nto a high degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, a number of scientists including Weinberg have\\nproposed nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics in which the superposition principle\\nis violated. Many of these proposals exhibit pathologies such as violations of the second\\nlaw of thermodynamics or the capacity for superluminal communication. Despite such\\ntheoretical difficulties, it is still possible that quantum mechanics does indeed possess a\\nsmall nonlinearity, even if it currently seems unlikely. If a nonlinear operation such as\\nthat proposed by Weinberg can be incorporated in a quantum logic operation, then the\\nconsequences are striking: NP-complete problems can be solved easily in polynomial time\\n[17]. Indeed, NP-oracle problems and all problems in #P can be solved in polynomial time\\non such a nonlinear quantum computer.\\n      A general proof of this result is given in [17], however, a simple argument for why\\nthis is so can be seen as follows. Suppose that it is possible to perform a non-unitary\\noperation on a single qubit that has a positive Lyapunov exponent over some region: i.e.,\\nsomewhere on the unit sphere there exists a line of finite extent along which application of\\nthe operation causes nearby points to move apart exponentially at a rate eŒª‚àÜŒ∏ proportional\\n                                                           5', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '0777fa16-f0d4-4ad9-9877-a4abca0ba70f', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'to their original angular separation Œ¥Œ∏. Now consider a function f (x) from N bits to one\\nbit. We wish to determine whether or not there exists an x such that f (x) = 1, and if\\nso, how many such x‚Äôs there are. Using the nonlinear operation with positive Lyapunov\\nexponent, it is straightforward to construct a mapping leaves a point on the exponentially\\nexpanding line (call this point |0„Äâ) fixed if their are no solutions to the equation f (x) = 1,\\nand that maps the point to a nearby point cos(n/2N )|0„Äâ + sin(n/2N )|1„Äâ along the line\\nif there are exactly n solutions to the equation f (x) = 1. Repeated application of the\\nnonlinear map can be used to drive the points apart at an exponentional rate: eventually,\\nat a time determined by the number of qubits N , the number of solutions n, and the rate\\nof spreading Œª, the two points will become macroscopically distinguishable, allowing one\\nto determine whether or not there is a solution and if there is, how many solutions there\\nare. The map f need only be applied once, and the amount of time it takes to reveal the\\nnumber of solutions is proportional to N .\\n      The fact that nonlinear quantum mechanics allows the straightforward solution of\\nNP-complete and #P problems should probably be regarded as yet another strike against\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. Whether or not quantum mechanics is linear is a question\\nto be resolved experimentally, however. In the unlikely event that quantum mechanics\\ndoes turn out to be nonlinear, all our problems may be solved.\\n      Finally, let us turn our attention to hypothetical quantum Theories of Everything,\\nsuch as string theory. Such a theory must clearly support quantum computation since it\\nsupports cavity quantum electrodynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance. The obvious\\nquestion to ask is then, does a Theory of Everything need to support anything more than\\nquantum computation? So far as experimental evidence is concerned the answer to this\\nquestion is apparently No: we have no evident reason to doubt that the universe is at\\nbottom anything more than a giant, parallel, quantum information processing machine,\\nand that the phenomena that we observe and attempt to characterize are simply outputs\\nof this machine‚Äôs ongoing computation. Of course, just how the universe is carrying out\\nthis computation is likely to remain a question of great interest for some time.\\n      To summarize: Computers are physical systems, and what they can do in practice and\\nin principle is circumscribed by the laws of physics. The laws of physics in turn permit a\\nwide variety of quantum computational devices including some based on nonconventional\\nstatistics and exotic effects. Modifications made to the laws of physics have the consequence\\nthat what can be computed in practice and in principle changes.

The overarching long-term goal of the research\\n                                    field is to construct photonic quantum networks where remote entanglement can be\\n                                    distributed over long distances by photons.\\n\\n                  1. Introduction\\n\\n                  The ultimate vision of photonic quantum technology is to construct a complex quantum\\n                  network of stationary quantum nodes connected by flying photons in a fully quantum\\n                  way, i.e.      quantum entanglement may become distributed.                          Such a new photonic\\n                  paradigm would have novel applications within secure quantum communication and\\n                  is proposed as a way of scaling up quantum computers. It is popularly referred to as the\\n                  ‚Äôquantum internet‚Äô [1] and has been rooted in the atomic physics community where an\\n                  impressive proof-of-concept elementary two-node quantum network has been achieved\\n                  [2]. Solid-state alternatives to atomic single-photon emitters are attractive, since unlike\\n                  atoms they do not require complex laser cooling and trapping techniques. On the\\n                  other hand solid-state systems are often considered to be ‚Äônoisy‚Äô in the sense that many\\n                  potential decoherence processes may deteriorate quantum properties. Remarkably, self-\\n                  assembled quantum dots (QDs) emitting single photons in the optical domain, notably\\n                  InGaAs QDs embedded in GaAs semiconductors, have matured dramatically within\\n                  the last few years. By systematically studying and combating the relevant decoherence\\n                  processes [3] impressive coherence has been demonstrated including near-perfect single-\\n                  photon indistinguishability (above 98%) of two subsequently emitted photons [4, 5] and\\n                  transform-limited emission lines [6].

At present, a number of basic functionalities have been\\nsuccessfully demonstrated with generally impressive performance. These may constitute\\nfundamental building blocks of photonic quantum networks. In that sense a current\\nmajor challenge for theoretical quantum physicist is to develop resource efficient\\narchitectures tailored to the specific quantum hardware available, i.e., addressing how\\nthe basic ‚Äôpuzzle pieces‚Äô can be combined. Figure 1 illustrates the ‚Äôpuzzle pieces‚Äô already\\nbeing developed for the QD platform, and that will be considered here. They include\\nsingle-photon sources, single-photon nonlinearity, photonic circuitry, efficient-coupling\\nto optical fibers, on-chip single-photon detectors, and multi-emitter coupling.\\n      QDs enable two different types of quantum resources: they may be employed\\nas a source of single photons or alternatively a single spin trapped in a QD may be\\nmanipulated as a qubit. Figure 2 illustrates these two approaches. In the former case a\\nsingle electron-hole pair is created in a QD by either optical excitation or by controllably\\ntunneling carriers into the QD with the application of an electric field. The electron-\\nhole pair subsequently recombines whereby a single photon is emitted by spontaneous\\nemission within a lifetime of typically 1 ns for a QD in a bulk medium. In the latter\\napproach a single carrier (electron or hole) is prepared in the QD by tunneling. The\\ncarrier spin is coupled to light since a photon may subsequently be absorbed by the QD\\ncreating a negatively (positively) charged exciton for the case of an initial electron (hole).\\nDepending on the operational condition, the spin may have a coherence time of up to\\n1 Œºs (for holes) [13, 14], which means that in principle many quantum operations can\\nbe carried out with fast optical control techniques before decoherence sets in. For some\\nquantum-information applications, however, longer spin coherence times are required,\\ne.g., in matter based quantum-repeater architectures. To this end, the QD platform\\nmust be interfaced with long-lived quantum memories based on, e.g., defect centers\\nin diamond or atomic ensembles [15].

Single-photon sources\\n\\nA QD efficiently coupled to a nanophotonic cavity or waveguide offers a promising\\nroute towards a deterministic single-photon source. Early pioneering work showed that\\nPurcell enhancement in an optical cavity may be employed to both improve brightness\\nand coherence of the source [16]. Ideally a useful single-photon source emits an optical\\npulse containing a single photon in a useful optical mode (e.g., into an optical fiber)\\nevery time the QD is triggered by either an optical or electrical pulse. Furthermore,\\nmost applications in quantum-information processing require that the emitted photons\\nare fully coherent, which entails that decoherence processes occurring on a time scale\\nof the radiative decay of the QD must be eliminated. Thus, three major figures-of-\\nmerit need to be optimized: i) the single-photon purity, ii) the single-photon coupling\\nefficiency, and iii) the indistinguishability of the emitted photons.\\n      Re i): The discrete level structure of self-assembled QDs having widely separated\\noptical transitions implies that they are capable of emitting high-purity single photons\\n[17]. This is gauged in a Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) correlation experiment by\\nrecording the multi-photon emission probability. By using samples with a low QD\\ndensity and implementing (quasi)-resonant excitation to selectively excite only a single\\nQD, excellent single-photon purity can be obtained at the level of g(2)(0) ‚â§ 0.1%, cf.\\nFig. 3.\\n      Re ii): The overall coupling efficiency determines the brightness of the single-photon\\nsource and is comprised of several factors [7]: the excitation and single-photon emission\\nprobability of the QD, the efficiency with which the emitted photons are channeled to a\\nsingle mode (the Œ≤-factor), and the transfer efficiency to a low-loss propagating mode,\\ne.g., an optical fiber. Significant progress has been reported on all three engineering\\ntasks: resonant œÄ-pulse excitation allows deterministically preparing a single exciton in\\na QD [18] and electrically gated structures eliminate blinking between different exciton\\ncomplexes [19]. Embedding QDs in photonic nanostructures allows reaching a near-\\nunity Œ≤-factor, which has been obtained in nanophotonic waveguides [8, 20] and cavities\\n[4]. Finally, a variety of approaches and designs can be implemented for transferring\\nthe collected photons to an optical fiber using, e.g., tailored gratings for coupling light\\nguided on planar structures vertically off the chip, or waveguide taper sections designed\\nto couple directly to a fiber either by direct or evanescent coupling [21, 22, 23].\\n      Re iii): The indistinguishability of an emitted photon is determined by the amount\\nof decoherence taking place within the emitter decay time. With a typical decay time\\nof nanoseconds, the primary decoherence source is coupling of the QD to phonons\\nand potentially photon jitter induced by relaxation processes originating from non-\\nresonant excitation schemes [24].               The latter may be overcome by strict resonant\\nexcitation.      Phonon interactions at the contrary are unavoidable and lead to two\\neffects: wide phonon sidebands and residual broadening of the zero-phonon line. The\\nformer contribution (containing typically about 10 % of the the total emission at\\nlow temperatures [7]) can readily be filtered away either by an external filter thereby', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'de71718d-112b-478e-b755-5c7d40825e52', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                  5\\n\\nreducing the overall efficiency or more favorably by implementing narrow-band Purcell\\nenhancement. Hence the broadening of the zero-phonon line remains the fundamental\\ndecoherence mechanism. An in-depth theoretical study of this process including the\\nrole of the dimensionality of the photonic nanostructure can be found in Ref. [25].\\nImportantly a clear route to indistinguishable photons with near-unity visibility can be\\nlaid out, which has also been confirmed experimentally [4, 5, 26].\\n     The previous discussion illustrates that QDs are capable of producing a truly on-\\ndemand source of single photons by implementing, in a single device, the functionalities\\ndemonstrated so far only in different experiments. It is likely that such a source will\\nbe developed experimentally soon. In particular, it is remarkable that decoherence\\nprocesses can be overcome in a solid-state system to such an extent that near-unity\\nindistinguishability between subsequently emitted photons from the same QD can be\\nobtained. Next step is to convert a single QD source generating photons as ‚Äùpearls\\non a string‚Äù into a de-multiplexed source delivering many identical single photons\\nsimultaneously in individual modes. Such a source can be constructed by cascading\\nelectro-optical switches and coupling the photons into different optical fibers in order\\nto overcome the time delay between subsequently emitted photons, cf. Fig. 4(a).\\nTo this end, the demonstration of near-transform-limited QD emission lines [6] has\\nthe remarkable consequence that a single QD can emit thousands of indistinguishable\\nphotons thereby providing a huge quantum resource. Indeed recent demonstration of\\nindistinguishability exceeding 90 % between two photons separated by more than 1000\\nemission events has proven this explicitly [27].\\n\\n3. Integrated quantum photonics\\n\\nAs detailed in the previous section, currently the most reliable approach to generate\\nmultiple single photons utilizes a single integrated QD source where the photons\\nare coupled off-chip to an optical fiber, and highly-efficient bulk optical components\\nimplemented for switching and routing, cf. Fig. 4(a). Nonetheless, the potential benefits\\nof integrating functionalities on-chip are many in terms of stability, ease of operation,\\nlow loss, and speed [28].           Figure 4(b) shows an architecture for an integrated de-\\nmultiplexed source of single photons based on a single QD in a planar nanophotonic\\nwaveguide platform.          To implement this scheme requires the development of high-\\nefficiency and fast switches, and multi-port waveguide-fiber interfaces. The former\\nrequires the development of new devices and functionalities on-chip where so-far the\\nmost common approach for reconfigurable circuitry has been the application of thermo-\\noptic phase shifters [29]. De-multiplexing requires fast switches, and two promising\\napproaches include electro-optical modulation implemented directly in the host material\\nof the QD (i.e. GaAs) [30, 31] or electro-mechanical coupling [32].\\n     The crucial parameter determining the size of the photonic resource that can be\\ngenerated with a de-multiplexed single-photon source is the overall efficiency, including\\nswitching, propagation, and coupling efficiencies.

Another\\nimportant task is to develop complex integrated tunable photonic circuits that can\\nprocess the generated single photons leading to applications for quantum simulations\\n[33]. Current state-of-the-art of this technology is a six-mode reprogrammable circuit\\ncapable of implementing universal high-fidelity quantum gates [29]. Considerable effort\\nis directed to the scaling of these circuits in working towards a fully integrated system\\nwhere photon source and processing circuit would be implemented on a single photonic\\nchip. However, implementing on-chip the relatively long optical delays (typically tens of\\nnanoseconds) required to interfere subsequently emitted photons, poses a challenge for\\nthis approach in requiring slow-light optical buffers. Consequently at present it seems\\nmost realistic to consider approaches based on two separate chips, connected by optical\\nfibers, where one chip constitutes the source and the other chip the quantum processor.\\n      The operation wavelength of a quantum photonics processor is an essential\\nparameter. The preferred operation wavelength is within the telecom C-band (1.55 Œºm),\\nwhere advanced high-performance optical components and fiber technology developed\\nfor telecom industry are present. The natural emission wavelength of self-assembled high\\nquality QDs is around 950 nm and while significant efforts are taken to develop QDs in\\nthe telecom bands as well [34, 35] the excellent performance in terms of coherence and\\nefficiency required for quantum technology has not yet been achieved.

Noise free conversion of single photons from a QD with an\\nefficiency exceeding 30% has been demonstrated [36], which could be further increased by\\nimproving the in- and out-coupling efficiency through the nonlinear conversion crystal.\\nThe two-chip approach alluded to above has the asset that the frequency conversion\\nstep could naturally be incorporated in between the source chip and the processing\\nchip. Furthermore, implementing frequency conversion of QD photons also has another\\nadvantage, since it provides a way of overcoming spectral inhomogeneities of photons\\nemitted by different QDs by transducing them to the same wavelength in the C-band\\nwith the implementation of a tunable pump laser. This could prove a powerful way of\\nscaling up QD systems to couple multiple emitter qubits (e.g., spins) in addition to the\\nmultiple photon qubits already considered.\\n      Finally, another essential requirement is the ability to detect optical photons with\\nvery high efficiency. Very significant progress has been obtained in recent years with the\\ndevelopment of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors [37], where the single-\\nphoton detection efficiency today approaches 100% and the speed is compatible with QD\\nsources. Importantly these detectors can naturally be integrated on the planar GaAs\\nplatform containing QDs [38], which means that photon source, circuit, and detection\\ncould potentially be integrated on a single chip, which may pave the way to ultimately\\nlow-loss photonic quantum nodes.\\n\\n4. Single-photon nonlinearity\\n\\nThe previous sections concerned the generation of single photons and their subsequent\\nquantum interference in photonic circuits. Many quantum-information applications\\nof photons require generating photon-photon interactions. Generally photons interact\\nweakly meaning that standard nonlinearities are typically too weak to be operational\\nat the level of single photons. However, the efficient coupling of single QDs to photonic\\nnanostructures imply that such a system may be exploited to mediate a giant nonlinear\\nresponse operational at the level of single photons. Two different approaches can be\\ntaken to reach a giant nonlinearity with a QD or any other quantum emitter: the QD\\ncan be strongly coupled to a cavity and the nonlinearity of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder\\nexploited [39, 40], or a QD very efficiently coupled to a single optical mode in a cavity\\n[41, 42] or waveguide [43] may be used as a saturable nonlinearity. The latter approach\\nis beneficial for ease of operation, since it is less sensitive to the exact tuning of the\\nwavelength of the QD. Furthermore, the saturable QD nonlinearity generally can be\\noperated at a weaker incident photon flux [43]. The key operational principle of the QD\\nnonlinearity is as follows: a narrow-band pulse containing a single photon is reflected\\nfrom a QD in a waveguide due to destructive interference of forward scattering and the\\nincoming field. The efficient coupling (high Œ≤-factor) and coherent interaction, which\\ncan be achieved with QDs, implies that the interaction between the photon and the\\nQD is deterministic. Since a two-level emitter can only scatter one photon at a time,', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'c1b95287-4dfa-411d-8269-8450b9dac1db', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                     9\\n\\ntwo photons have an increased probability to be transmitted past the QD leading to a\\nphoton sorting process. From an experimental point of view this type of nonlinearity\\nis attractive since no active control over the quantum state of the QD is required,\\ni.e., the QD is merely exploited as a passive scatterer. On the other hand, the photon\\nsorting is not ideal even for a perfect coupling efficiency. This implies that while a single-\\nphoton component of a pulse may be deterministically reflected, two- and higher-photon\\ncomponents are only partially transmitted and in this process entanglement is generated\\nbetween the two photons [44]. One approach of overcoming this limitation and obtain\\ndeterministic photon sorting has been suggested by combining the QD nonlinearity with\\na nonlinear spatio-temporal mode selector [45]. Such an approach may be applied for\\nconstructing a resource-efficient Bell-state analyzer [44, 45], cf. Section 7. It should be\\nmentioned that having a three-level emitter with coherent control of the level populations\\nin the waveguide opens a range of additional opportunities. Such level schemes can be\\nimplemented with charged QDs, cf. the description in the next section. One exciting\\nproposal is that of a photonic transistor controlled by only a single photon [46].\\n\\n5. Spin-photon interfaces\\n\\nIntroducing a single spin in a QD leads to a range of additional opportunities. It grants\\naccess to two separate ground states (spin up or down) that can be exploited as a\\nquantum memory to encode a qubit. Either single holes or electrons can be employed\\nand may be deterministically prepared by controlling the tunnel barriers in electrically\\ncontacted semiconductor structures. Various level structures can be implemented by the\\nuse of Zeeman tuning with a magnetic field, and spin initialization, manipulation, and\\nread-out can be achieved rapidly with short optical pulses (typically in the nanosecond\\nrange), cf.      Ref.    [19] for a detailed review of the physics of single spins in QDs.\\nThe spin lifetime can be in the range of milliseconds or longer in a large magnetic\\nfield, which is determined by phonon-mediated spin relaxation processes. However,\\nin quantum applications the coherence time of the spin is the essential parameter.\\nA coherence time of up to T 2‚àó > 460 ns has been reported for hole spins that has\\nthe advantage compared to electrons that they do not suffer from the Fermi contact\\nhyperfine interaction with nuclear spins [14]. Importantly the spin coherence time can\\nbe several orders of magnitude longer than the spin manipulation time, which means\\nthat multiple quantum gate operations could be implemented within the spin coherence\\ntime. Unravelling spin decoherence mechanisms in QDs is a research topic in itself and is\\noutside the scope of the present review. For a thorough discussion, see Refs. [19, 47]. It\\nis anticipated that further research efforts will enable increasing the spin coherence time\\nfurther. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that it will be possible to extend the coherence\\ntime by many orders of magnitude in present QD systems. In particular, long-range\\nquantum repeater protocols would require millisecond range quantum memories.

The recombination of a charged exciton\\n leads to the emission of polarized photons, where the polarization of the photon is\\n correlated with the resulting spin state. In this way entanglement between the QD\\n spin and the polarization of the emitted photon can be generated [13, 50] where\\n in general hyper-entanglement between spin, polarization, and frequency is obtained.\\n Subsequently the information in one of the variables can be erased to create a Bell state.\\n This has been the resource enabling quantum teleportation between a single photon and\\n a solid-state spin [51]. A further extension of this experiment was the demonstration of\\n heralded entanglement between two spatially separate hole spins in QDs [52], cf. Fig. 5\\n for the experimental layout.\\n      Another possibility is to couple QD spins directly to photon path by exploiting\\n the concept of chiral light-matter interaction [53]. By tailoring the local electric field\\n in a nanophotonic waveguide to match the in-plane circular dipole moment of one of\\n the charged exciton transitions, it is possible to induce deterministic directional photon\\n emission [54], i.e. œÉ¬± transitions emit in different directions. This effect was used\\nto demonstrate an interface between QD spin and the photon path [55]. Based on\\nthis functionality a photonic quantum network architecture was put forward and its\\nfeasibility evaluated for QDs in nanophotonic waveguides [56], cf. Fig. 5.\\n\\n6. Coupling of multiple quantum dots\\n\\nWe have seen in previous sections how a single QD deterministically coupled to a single\\noptical mode may be exploited as a source of multiple photonic qubits potentially\\ngenerating a large quantum resource. It is natural to consider the option of scaling\\nfurther up by coupling multiple QDs. This is generally a demanding task, as it is\\nthe case for any solid-state optical emitter, since inhomogeneous broadening of a QD\\nensemble (typically at the level of THz, which should be compared to the sub-GHz\\nhomogenous linewidth of a QD) implies that significant spectral mismatch would need\\nto be overcome. Various tuning methods of QDs have been implemented including\\nelectric-field tuning [57] and strain tuning [58] that needs to be implemented locally to\\neach individual QD.

Quantum network architectures\\n\\nWe have reviewed various basic quantum functionalities and hardware that can be\\nimplemented with the use of QDs embedded in modern nanophotonic structures. It\\nis a pertinent task, to consider what applications and actual architectures can be\\nimplemented with these quantum resources and how to make them most resource\\nefficient. This section briefly highlights some of the opportunities and future directions.\\nA general observation, as discussed in detail above, is that QD systems can generate\\nmany single-photon qubits, while the scaling up to many matter qubits is expected to\\nbe much more challenging. It is important to have these general guidelines in mind\\nwhen designing resource efficient quantum network architectures that is tailored to the\\nquantum hardware based on QDs.\\n     As discussed in the present Review, QDs in nanophotonic structures are very well\\nsuited for generating highly coherent single photons on demand at a high repetition\\nrate. Such a source can generate thousands of indistinguishable photons [27] that if\\nefficiently routed could be an important photonic resource for quantum simulations [33].\\nFurthermore, recent developments on how to efficiently fuse photonic qubits with linear\\noptics have the renewed excitement on how to construct single-photon based quantum\\ncomputing [63].\\n     Introducing a single-photon nonlinearity to the toolbox opens for a range of\\nadditional possibilities. The most simple case is that of a two-level emitter, and here\\ndistortion of the optical pulses associated with photon-emitter bound state contributions\\nhas been interpreted as essentially a ‚Äùno-go theorem‚Äù for quantum computation [64].\\nOne work around, however, has been identified where the pulse distortion is actually\\nexploited such that one- and two-photon pulses are scattered into orthogonal spectral-\\ntemporal modes that can subsequently be separated, e.g., by nonlinear frequency\\nconversion [45]. With such a functionality all path-encoded photonic Bell states can\\nbe deterministically measured exploiting only four non-linear interaction process, linear\\noptics, and photon detection, cf. Fig. 6. Based on a Bell-state analyzer, quantum\\ncomputing can in principle be implemented by teleportation based gates and linear\\noptical quantum computing [65]. Alternatively, a photonic CZ gate can be directly\\nbased on the two-level emitter nonlinearity. However, in this case the pulse distortion\\nintroduced by photon scattering has to be undone by scattering an additional time on\\nthe emitter. However, since this scattering process is not time symmetric the photon\\npulse would need to be reverted in time in between the two scattering process. Such a\\ntime reversal of the photon pulses could in principle be obtained by storing, reverting,\\nand releasing photon pulses in a gradient-echo quantum memory.\\n     Having access to a 3-level Œõ-scheme with two stable ground states leads to many\\nmore opportunities since now the emitter can store a qubit for extended times. Coherent\\ncontrol of the qubit state enables implementing a Duan-Kimble CNOT gate for photons\\nwhere two subsequently interacting photons are entangled by their successive interaction\\nwith the same emitter [66].

A full architecture of a quantum network based on QDs chirally coupled to\\nnanophotonic waveguides has been put forward in Ref. [56], cf. Fig. 5. Here the very\\nlarge cooperativity obtainable with QDs leads to a gate fidelity approaching unity for\\nexperimentally realistic parameters.\\n      Another highly exciting direction is to exploit a single QD efficiently coupled to a\\nnanophotonic waveguide to directly produce entangled photons.

In this proposal, a single QD spin is brought into a superposition\\nstate of up and down and optically excited to a superposition of charged exciton states.\\nSubsequently the QD decays by spontaneous emission of a single photon thereby creating\\nan entangled state between the polarization of the emitted photon and the spin state.\\nThe excitation-emission process can be repeated multiple times in which case a large\\nGHZ photonic state is generated. If œÄ/2 rotations on the QD spin are carried out\\nin-between photon emissions, an entangled photonic cluster state is created. A QD\\nembedded in a nanophotonic waveguide could potentially serve as a source of large 1D\\ncluster states, where the cluster size is determined by the number of emission events\\n(determined by the QD lifetime that is typically ‚àº 100 ps in a nanophotonic structure)\\nthat can take place within the coherence time of the spin (up to ‚àº Œºs). A pioneering\\nexperiment of photonic cluster state generation with a QD source has recently been\\nreported [9], which validates the approach.\\n     Cluster states have attracted a lot of attention since it was realized that they enable\\nuniversal quantum computing. The general philosophy behind such one-way quantum\\ncomputing architectures [70] is that a large scale entangled state is generated ‚Äùup front‚Äù\\nand computation carried out by single-qubit operations induced by measurements.\\nImportantly, quantum computing requires access to 2D photonic cluster states as\\nopposed to the 1D cluster states considered above.                       Several proposals of how to\\nachieve this with QDs have been put forward. One approach is to optically couple\\ntwo QDs [71], which requires local tuning of the two QDs into mutual resonance. An\\nalternative proposal has been put forward based on a single quantum emitter, where the\\nemitted photons are controllably coupled back to interact with the emitter and through\\nthis process generates the 2D cluster [72]. Such a ‚Äùone-emitter quantum-computer\\narchitecture‚Äù is almost ideally suited for implementation based on QDs in nanophotonic\\nstructures. Another exciting potential applications of photonic cluster states would be in\\nquantum repeater protocols without the necessity of a matter-based quantum memory\\n[73, 74]. Such an approach would potentially overcome the main bottleneck of the QD\\nbased platform for quantum networks resulting from the relatively short-lived quantum\\nmemory offered by the QD spin.\\n\\n8. Conclusions\\n\\nQDs in photonic nanostructures constitute an unprecedent photon-emitter interface at\\noptical frequencies. The recent significant progress implies that advanced quantum-\\ninformation processing protocols now become within experimental reach in the overall\\nquest towards constructing photonic quantum networks. Such a distributed photonic\\nquantum network would open new avenues for secure quantum communication and\\nultimately provide a way of scaling up quantum computers.

So far, a number of experimental tests of quantum non-locality based\\n                                     on Bell‚Äôs theorem [1] have been carried out [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In these experiments\\n                                     entangled photon pairs are produced, and the polarization correlation between\\n                                     entangled photon pairs is measured. Experimental results obtained in these tests\\n                                     are in favor for quantum non-locality. Although it has been pointed out that\\n                                     this polarization correlation is compatible with local realism [7], these results\\n                                     are generally considered as direct evidences for the existence of quantum non-\\n                                     locality, and more experiments [8, 9, 10] showing different kind of quantum\\n                                     non-local correlation are carried out. The entangled photon pairs are used as\\n                                     light source in these experiments, and the interpretation of the experimental\\n                                     results as proofs for quantum non-locality is closely related to the assumption\\n                                     that these photon pairs are in entangled quantum state.\\n                                          In this letter, I will show that the same polarization correlation also exists\\n                                     for certain un-entangled photon pairs. And on other hand, based on the consid-\\n                                     eration of momentum conservation, I will also show that the entangled quantum\\n                                     state is not a correct description for photon pairs used in these experimental\\n                                     tests of quantum non-locality.

The energy and the momentum\\nof a photon pair in the state |œàe„Äâ is equal to the energy and the momentum of\\nthe incident photon from which the photon pair is generated. But there is\\na problem in this argument, namely the parametric down conversion process\\ntakes place in nonlinear optical crystals, so one must take the photons and the\\ncrystal as one single system when the condition of the energy and the momen-\\ntum conservation is applied. The macroscopic properties of nonlinear optical\\ncrystals do not change in the parametric down conversion process. Thus the\\nexpectation values of the energy and the momentum of crystals are the same\\nbefore and after the photon pairs‚Äô generation. Therefore the expectation val-\\nues of energy and momentum of a photon pair must equal to the expectation\\nvalues of energy and momentum of incident photon. This condition is satisfied\\nby the quantum state |œàe„Äâ. On other hand, photons are coupled with optical\\nphonons with same momentum when passing through crystals, and there exist\\nexchanges of energy and momentum between photons and crystals through the\\nphoton-phonon interaction during photons‚Äô propagation in crystals. One may\\nneglect the energy exchange between photons and crystals because the ener-\\ngies of phonons are much smaller than that of photons with same momentum,\\nbut the momentum exchange between photons and crystals must be taken into\\nconsideration.

An experimental test on the possibility of\\ndetecting both of the photons in one single channel can be done by using an\\nexperimental setup shown in FIG. 2.

But till\\nnow, such a contradiction did not occur, because no particle pairs in entangled\\nquantum states had been produced. Can particle pairs in entangled quantum\\nstates be generated ever? It is most likely not. Due to the interaction with\\nthe source of particle pairs, it should be impossible for the produced particle\\npair with different momenta to be in a quantum state with well defined mo-\\nmentum, such as the entangled quantum state.

Quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures have in recent years\\n                                    proven to be a very powerful solid-state platform for quantum optics experiments.

As a result, high-cooperativity photon-\\n                                    emitter quantum interfaces can be constructed opening a path-way to deterministic\\n                                    photonic quantum gates for quantum-information processing applications.

The overarching long-term goal of the research\\n                                    field is to construct photonic quantum networks where remote entanglement can be\\n                                    distributed over long distances by photons.\\n\\n                  1. Introduction\\n\\n                  The ultimate vision of photonic quantum technology is to construct a complex quantum\\n                  network of stationary quantum nodes connected by flying photons in a fully quantum\\n                  way, i.e.      quantum entanglement may become distributed.                          Such a new photonic\\n                  paradigm would have novel applications within secure quantum communication and\\n                  is proposed as a way of scaling up quantum computers. It is popularly referred to as the\\n                  ‚Äôquantum internet‚Äô [1] and has been rooted in the atomic physics community where an\\n                  impressive proof-of-concept elementary two-node quantum network has been achieved\\n                  [2]. Solid-state alternatives to atomic single-photon emitters are attractive, since unlike\\n                  atoms they do not require complex laser cooling and trapping techniques. On the\\n                  other hand solid-state systems are often considered to be ‚Äônoisy‚Äô in the sense that many\\n                  potential decoherence processes may deteriorate quantum properties. Remarkably, self-\\n                  assembled quantum dots (QDs) emitting single photons in the optical domain, notably\\n                  InGaAs QDs embedded in GaAs semiconductors, have matured dramatically within\\n                  the last few years. By systematically studying and combating the relevant decoherence\\n                  processes [3] impressive coherence has been demonstrated including near-perfect single-\\n                  photon indistinguishability (above 98%) of two subsequently emitted photons [4, 5] and\\n                  transform-limited emission lines [6].

Time is now to build on these and other achievements in order\\nto scale QD photonic quantum technology and construct large and complex quantum\\narchitectures for quantum-information processing applications.\\n      The present manuscript reviews the current state-of-the-art on quantum photonics\\nbased on QD photon emitters towards the overarching goal of constructing photonic\\nquantum networks.              At present, a number of basic functionalities have been\\nsuccessfully demonstrated with generally impressive performance. These may constitute\\nfundamental building blocks of photonic quantum networks. In that sense a current\\nmajor challenge for theoretical quantum physicist is to develop resource efficient\\narchitectures tailored to the specific quantum hardware available, i.e., addressing how\\nthe basic ‚Äôpuzzle pieces‚Äô can be combined. Figure 1 illustrates the ‚Äôpuzzle pieces‚Äô already\\nbeing developed for the QD platform, and that will be considered here. They include\\nsingle-photon sources, single-photon nonlinearity, photonic circuitry, efficient-coupling\\nto optical fibers, on-chip single-photon detectors, and multi-emitter coupling.\\n      QDs enable two different types of quantum resources: they may be employed\\nas a source of single photons or alternatively a single spin trapped in a QD may be\\nmanipulated as a qubit. Figure 2 illustrates these two approaches. In the former case a\\nsingle electron-hole pair is created in a QD by either optical excitation or by controllably\\ntunneling carriers into the QD with the application of an electric field. The electron-\\nhole pair subsequently recombines whereby a single photon is emitted by spontaneous\\nemission within a lifetime of typically 1 ns for a QD in a bulk medium. In the latter\\napproach a single carrier (electron or hole) is prepared in the QD by tunneling. The\\ncarrier spin is coupled to light since a photon may subsequently be absorbed by the QD\\ncreating a negatively (positively) charged exciton for the case of an initial electron (hole).\\nDepending on the operational condition, the spin may have a coherence time of up to\\n1 Œºs (for holes) [13, 14], which means that in principle many quantum operations can\\nbe carried out with fast optical control techniques before decoherence sets in. For some\\nquantum-information applications, however, longer spin coherence times are required,\\ne.g., in matter based quantum-repeater architectures. To this end, the QD platform\\nmust be interfaced with long-lived quantum memories based on, e.g., defect centers\\nin diamond or atomic ensembles [15].

Single-photon sources\\n\\nA QD efficiently coupled to a nanophotonic cavity or waveguide offers a promising\\nroute towards a deterministic single-photon source. Early pioneering work showed that\\nPurcell enhancement in an optical cavity may be employed to both improve brightness\\nand coherence of the source [16]. Ideally a useful single-photon source emits an optical\\npulse containing a single photon in a useful optical mode (e.g., into an optical fiber)\\nevery time the QD is triggered by either an optical or electrical pulse. Furthermore,\\nmost applications in quantum-information processing require that the emitted photons\\nare fully coherent, which entails that decoherence processes occurring on a time scale\\nof the radiative decay of the QD must be eliminated. Thus, three major figures-of-\\nmerit need to be optimized: i) the single-photon purity, ii) the single-photon coupling\\nefficiency, and iii) the indistinguishability of the emitted photons.\\n      Re i): The discrete level structure of self-assembled QDs having widely separated\\noptical transitions implies that they are capable of emitting high-purity single photons\\n[17]. This is gauged in a Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) correlation experiment by\\nrecording the multi-photon emission probability. By using samples with a low QD\\ndensity and implementing (quasi)-resonant excitation to selectively excite only a single\\nQD, excellent single-photon purity can be obtained at the level of g(2)(0) ‚â§ 0.1%, cf.\\nFig. 3.\\n      Re ii): The overall coupling efficiency determines the brightness of the single-photon\\nsource and is comprised of several factors [7]: the excitation and single-photon emission\\nprobability of the QD, the efficiency with which the emitted photons are channeled to a\\nsingle mode (the Œ≤-factor), and the transfer efficiency to a low-loss propagating mode,\\ne.g., an optical fiber. Significant progress has been reported on all three engineering\\ntasks: resonant œÄ-pulse excitation allows deterministically preparing a single exciton in\\na QD [18] and electrically gated structures eliminate blinking between different exciton\\ncomplexes [19]. Embedding QDs in photonic nanostructures allows reaching a near-\\nunity Œ≤-factor, which has been obtained in nanophotonic waveguides [8, 20] and cavities\\n[4]. Finally, a variety of approaches and designs can be implemented for transferring\\nthe collected photons to an optical fiber using, e.g., tailored gratings for coupling light\\nguided on planar structures vertically off the chip, or waveguide taper sections designed\\nto couple directly to a fiber either by direct or evanescent coupling [21, 22, 23].\\n      Re iii): The indistinguishability of an emitted photon is determined by the amount\\nof decoherence taking place within the emitter decay time. With a typical decay time\\nof nanoseconds, the primary decoherence source is coupling of the QD to phonons\\nand potentially photon jitter induced by relaxation processes originating from non-\\nresonant excitation schemes [24].               The latter may be overcome by strict resonant\\nexcitation.      Phonon interactions at the contrary are unavoidable and lead to two\\neffects: wide phonon sidebands and residual broadening of the zero-phonon line. The\\nformer contribution (containing typically about 10 % of the the total emission at\\nlow temperatures [7]) can readily be filtered away either by an external filter thereby', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'de71718d-112b-478e-b755-5c7d40825e52', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'Quantum-dot based photonic quantum networks                                                  5\\n\\nreducing the overall efficiency or more favorably by implementing narrow-band Purcell\\nenhancement. Hence the broadening of the zero-phonon line remains the fundamental\\ndecoherence mechanism. An in-depth theoretical study of this process including the\\nrole of the dimensionality of the photonic nanostructure can be found in Ref. [25].\\nImportantly a clear route to indistinguishable photons with near-unity visibility can be\\nlaid out, which has also been confirmed experimentally [4, 5, 26].\\n     The previous discussion illustrates that QDs are capable of producing a truly on-\\ndemand source of single photons by implementing, in a single device, the functionalities\\ndemonstrated so far only in different experiments. It is likely that such a source will\\nbe developed experimentally soon. In particular, it is remarkable that decoherence\\nprocesses can be overcome in a solid-state system to such an extent that near-unity\\nindistinguishability between subsequently emitted photons from the same QD can be\\nobtained. Next step is to convert a single QD source generating photons as ‚Äùpearls\\non a string‚Äù into a de-multiplexed source delivering many identical single photons\\nsimultaneously in individual modes. Such a source can be constructed by cascading\\nelectro-optical switches and coupling the photons into different optical fibers in order\\nto overcome the time delay between subsequently emitted photons, cf. Fig. 4(a).\\nTo this end, the demonstration of near-transform-limited QD emission lines [6] has\\nthe remarkable consequence that a single QD can emit thousands of indistinguishable\\nphotons thereby providing a huge quantum resource. Indeed recent demonstration of\\nindistinguishability exceeding 90 % between two photons separated by more than 1000\\nemission events has proven this explicitly [27].\\n\\n3. Integrated quantum photonics\\n\\nAs detailed in the previous section, currently the most reliable approach to generate\\nmultiple single photons utilizes a single integrated QD source where the photons\\nare coupled off-chip to an optical fiber, and highly-efficient bulk optical components\\nimplemented for switching and routing, cf. Fig. 4(a). Nonetheless, the potential benefits\\nof integrating functionalities on-chip are many in terms of stability, ease of operation,\\nlow loss, and speed [28].           Figure 4(b) shows an architecture for an integrated de-\\nmultiplexed source of single photons based on a single QD in a planar nanophotonic\\nwaveguide platform.          To implement this scheme requires the development of high-\\nefficiency and fast switches, and multi-port waveguide-fiber interfaces.

Another\\nimportant task is to develop complex integrated tunable photonic circuits that can\\nprocess the generated single photons leading to applications for quantum simulations\\n[33]. Current state-of-the-art of this technology is a six-mode reprogrammable circuit\\ncapable of implementing universal high-fidelity quantum gates [29]. Considerable effort\\nis directed to the scaling of these circuits in working towards a fully integrated system\\nwhere photon source and processing circuit would be implemented on a single photonic\\nchip. However, implementing on-chip the relatively long optical delays (typically tens of\\nnanoseconds) required to interfere subsequently emitted photons, poses a challenge for\\nthis approach in requiring slow-light optical buffers. Consequently at present it seems\\nmost realistic to consider approaches based on two separate chips, connected by optical\\nfibers, where one chip constitutes the source and the other chip the quantum processor.\\n      The operation wavelength of a quantum photonics processor is an essential\\nparameter. The preferred operation wavelength is within the telecom C-band (1.55 Œºm),\\nwhere advanced high-performance optical components and fiber technology developed\\nfor telecom industry are present. The natural emission wavelength of self-assembled high\\nquality QDs is around 950 nm and while significant efforts are taken to develop QDs in\\nthe telecom bands as well [34, 35] the excellent performance in terms of coherence and\\nefficiency required for quantum technology has not yet been achieved.

Noise free conversion of single photons from a QD with an\\nefficiency exceeding 30% has been demonstrated [36], which could be further increased by\\nimproving the in- and out-coupling efficiency through the nonlinear conversion crystal.\\nThe two-chip approach alluded to above has the asset that the frequency conversion\\nstep could naturally be incorporated in between the source chip and the processing\\nchip. Furthermore, implementing frequency conversion of QD photons also has another\\nadvantage, since it provides a way of overcoming spectral inhomogeneities of photons\\nemitted by different QDs by transducing them to the same wavelength in the C-band\\nwith the implementation of a tunable pump laser. This could prove a powerful way of\\nscaling up QD systems to couple multiple emitter qubits (e.g., spins) in addition to the\\nmultiple photon qubits already considered.\\n      Finally, another essential requirement is the ability to detect optical photons with\\nvery high efficiency. Very significant progress has been obtained in recent years with the\\ndevelopment of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors [37], where the single-\\nphoton detection efficiency today approaches 100% and the speed is compatible with QD\\nsources. Importantly these detectors can naturally be integrated on the planar GaAs\\nplatform containing QDs [38], which means that photon source, circuit, and detection\\ncould potentially be integrated on a single chip, which may pave the way to ultimately\\nlow-loss photonic quantum nodes.\\n\\n4. Single-photon nonlinearity\\n\\nThe previous sections concerned the generation of single photons and their subsequent\\nquantum interference in photonic circuits. Many quantum-information applications\\nof photons require generating photon-photon interactions. Generally photons interact\\nweakly meaning that standard nonlinearities are typically too weak to be operational\\nat the level of single photons. However, the efficient coupling of single QDs to photonic\\nnanostructures imply that such a system may be exploited to mediate a giant nonlinear\\nresponse operational at the level of single photons. Two different approaches can be\\ntaken to reach a giant nonlinearity with a QD or any other quantum emitter: the QD\\ncan be strongly coupled to a cavity and the nonlinearity of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder\\nexploited [39, 40], or a QD very efficiently coupled to a single optical mode in a cavity\\n[41, 42] or waveguide [43] may be used as a saturable nonlinearity. The latter approach\\nis beneficial for ease of operation, since it is less sensitive to the exact tuning of the\\nwavelength of the QD. Furthermore, the saturable QD nonlinearity generally can be\\noperated at a weaker incident photon flux [43]. The key operational principle of the QD\\nnonlinearity is as follows: a narrow-band pulse containing a single photon is reflected\\nfrom a QD in a waveguide due to destructive interference of forward scattering and the\\nincoming field. The efficient coupling (high Œ≤-factor) and coherent interaction, which\\ncan be achieved with QDs, implies that the interaction between the photon and the\\nQD is deterministic.

On the other hand, the photon\\nsorting is not ideal even for a perfect coupling efficiency. This implies that while a single-\\nphoton component of a pulse may be deterministically reflected, two- and higher-photon\\ncomponents are only partially transmitted and in this process entanglement is generated\\nbetween the two photons [44]. One approach of overcoming this limitation and obtain\\ndeterministic photon sorting has been suggested by combining the QD nonlinearity with\\na nonlinear spatio-temporal mode selector [45]. Such an approach may be applied for\\nconstructing a resource-efficient Bell-state analyzer [44, 45], cf. Section 7. It should be\\nmentioned that having a three-level emitter with coherent control of the level populations\\nin the waveguide opens a range of additional opportunities. Such level schemes can be\\nimplemented with charged QDs, cf. the description in the next section. One exciting\\nproposal is that of a photonic transistor controlled by only a single photon [46].\\n\\n5. Spin-photon interfaces\\n\\nIntroducing a single spin in a QD leads to a range of additional opportunities. It grants\\naccess to two separate ground states (spin up or down) that can be exploited as a\\nquantum memory to encode a qubit. Either single holes or electrons can be employed\\nand may be deterministically prepared by controlling the tunnel barriers in electrically\\ncontacted semiconductor structures. Various level structures can be implemented by the\\nuse of Zeeman tuning with a magnetic field, and spin initialization, manipulation, and\\nread-out can be achieved rapidly with short optical pulses (typically in the nanosecond\\nrange), cf.      Ref.    [19] for a detailed review of the physics of single spins in QDs.\\nThe spin lifetime can be in the range of milliseconds or longer in a large magnetic\\nfield, which is determined by phonon-mediated spin relaxation processes. However,\\nin quantum applications the coherence time of the spin is the essential parameter.\\nA coherence time of up to T 2‚àó > 460 ns has been reported for hole spins that has\\nthe advantage compared to electrons that they do not suffer from the Fermi contact\\nhyperfine interaction with nuclear spins [14]. Importantly the spin coherence time can\\nbe several orders of magnitude longer than the spin manipulation time, which means\\nthat multiple quantum gate operations could be implemented within the spin coherence\\ntime. Unravelling spin decoherence mechanisms in QDs is a research topic in itself and is\\noutside the scope of the present review. For a thorough discussion, see Refs. [19, 47]. It\\nis anticipated that further research efforts will enable increasing the spin coherence time\\nfurther. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that it will be possible to extend the coherence\\ntime by many orders of magnitude in present QD systems. In particular, long-range\\nquantum repeater protocols would require millisecond range quantum memories.

The recombination of a charged exciton\\n leads to the emission of polarized photons, where the polarization of the photon is\\n correlated with the resulting spin state. In this way entanglement between the QD\\n spin and the polarization of the emitted photon can be generated [13, 50] where\\n in general hyper-entanglement between spin, polarization, and frequency is obtained.\\n Subsequently the information in one of the variables can be erased to create a Bell state.\\n This has been the resource enabling quantum teleportation between a single photon and\\n a solid-state spin [51]. A further extension of this experiment was the demonstration of\\n heralded entanglement between two spatially separate hole spins in QDs [52], cf. Fig. 5\\n for the experimental layout.\\n      Another possibility is to couple QD spins directly to photon path by exploiting\\n the concept of chiral light-matter interaction [53]. By tailoring the local electric field\\n in a nanophotonic waveguide to match the in-plane circular dipole moment of one of\\n the charged exciton transitions, it is possible to induce deterministic directional photon\\n emission [54], i.e. œÉ¬± transitions emit in different directions. This effect was used\\nto demonstrate an interface between QD spin and the photon path [55]. Based on\\nthis functionality a photonic quantum network architecture was put forward and its\\nfeasibility evaluated for QDs in nanophotonic waveguides [56], cf. Fig. 5.\\n\\n6. Coupling of multiple quantum dots\\n\\nWe have seen in previous sections how a single QD deterministically coupled to a single\\noptical mode may be exploited as a source of multiple photonic qubits potentially\\ngenerating a large quantum resource. It is natural to consider the option of scaling\\nfurther up by coupling multiple QDs. This is generally a demanding task, as it is\\nthe case for any solid-state optical emitter, since inhomogeneous broadening of a QD\\nensemble (typically at the level of THz, which should be compared to the sub-GHz\\nhomogenous linewidth of a QD) implies that significant spectral mismatch would need\\nto be overcome. Various tuning methods of QDs have been implemented including\\nelectric-field tuning [57] and strain tuning [58] that needs to be implemented locally to\\neach individual QD. Eventually not only the central emission frequency of the different\\nemitters must be controlled, but the complete photon pulses need to be matched in\\norder to faithfully couple multiple QDs. An important figure-of-merit of the success is\\ngauged in a quantum-interference experiment between two separate QD single-photon\\nsources, where an interference visibility of 93% has been reported in a weak-excitation\\nregime [59], which is a highly encouragin result for this approach.\\n      Given the ability to radiatively couple two or more QDs, a photonic nanostructure\\ncan be constructed to enhance and tailor the coupling.

Quantum network architectures\\n\\nWe have reviewed various basic quantum functionalities and hardware that can be\\nimplemented with the use of QDs embedded in modern nanophotonic structures. It\\nis a pertinent task, to consider what applications and actual architectures can be\\nimplemented with these quantum resources and how to make them most resource\\nefficient. This section briefly highlights some of the opportunities and future directions.\\nA general observation, as discussed in detail above, is that QD systems can generate\\nmany single-photon qubits, while the scaling up to many matter qubits is expected to\\nbe much more challenging. It is important to have these general guidelines in mind\\nwhen designing resource efficient quantum network architectures that is tailored to the\\nquantum hardware based on QDs.\\n     As discussed in the present Review, QDs in nanophotonic structures are very well\\nsuited for generating highly coherent single photons on demand at a high repetition\\nrate. Such a source can generate thousands of indistinguishable photons [27] that if\\nefficiently routed could be an important photonic resource for quantum simulations [33].\\nFurthermore, recent developments on how to efficiently fuse photonic qubits with linear\\noptics have the renewed excitement on how to construct single-photon based quantum\\ncomputing [63].\\n     Introducing a single-photon nonlinearity to the toolbox opens for a range of\\nadditional possibilities. The most simple case is that of a two-level emitter, and here\\ndistortion of the optical pulses associated with photon-emitter bound state contributions\\nhas been interpreted as essentially a ‚Äùno-go theorem‚Äù for quantum computation [64].\\nOne work around, however, has been identified where the pulse distortion is actually\\nexploited such that one- and two-photon pulses are scattered into orthogonal spectral-\\ntemporal modes that can subsequently be separated, e.g., by nonlinear frequency\\nconversion [45]. With such a functionality all path-encoded photonic Bell states can\\nbe deterministically measured exploiting only four non-linear interaction process, linear\\noptics, and photon detection, cf. Fig. 6. Based on a Bell-state analyzer, quantum\\ncomputing can in principle be implemented by teleportation based gates and linear\\noptical quantum computing [65]. Alternatively, a photonic CZ gate can be directly\\nbased on the two-level emitter nonlinearity. However, in this case the pulse distortion\\nintroduced by photon scattering has to be undone by scattering an additional time on\\nthe emitter. However, since this scattering process is not time symmetric the photon\\npulse would need to be reverted in time in between the two scattering process. Such a\\ntime reversal of the photon pulses could in principle be obtained by storing, reverting,\\nand releasing photon pulses in a gradient-echo quantum memory.\\n     Having access to a 3-level Œõ-scheme with two stable ground states leads to many\\nmore opportunities since now the emitter can store a qubit for extended times. Coherent\\ncontrol of the qubit state enables implementing a Duan-Kimble CNOT gate for photons\\nwhere two subsequently interacting photons are entangled by their successive interaction\\nwith the same emitter [66].

A pioneering\\nexperiment of photonic cluster state generation with a QD source has recently been\\nreported [9], which validates the approach.\\n     Cluster states have attracted a lot of attention since it was realized that they enable\\nuniversal quantum computing. The general philosophy behind such one-way quantum\\ncomputing architectures [70] is that a large scale entangled state is generated ‚Äùup front‚Äù\\nand computation carried out by single-qubit operations induced by measurements.\\nImportantly, quantum computing requires access to 2D photonic cluster states as\\nopposed to the 1D cluster states considered above.                       Several proposals of how to\\nachieve this with QDs have been put forward. One approach is to optically couple\\ntwo QDs [71], which requires local tuning of the two QDs into mutual resonance. An\\nalternative proposal has been put forward based on a single quantum emitter, where the\\nemitted photons are controllably coupled back to interact with the emitter and through\\nthis process generates the 2D cluster [72]. Such a ‚Äùone-emitter quantum-computer\\narchitecture‚Äù is almost ideally suited for implementation based on QDs in nanophotonic\\nstructures. Another exciting potential applications of photonic cluster states would be in\\nquantum repeater protocols without the necessity of a matter-based quantum memory\\n[73, 74]. Such an approach would potentially overcome the main bottleneck of the QD\\nbased platform for quantum networks resulting from the relatively short-lived quantum\\nmemory offered by the QD spin.\\n\\n8.

It is shown that unconventional quantum computing devices can in prin-\\n                 ciple compute some quantities more rapidly than ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n\\n                      Computers are physical: what they can and cannot do is determined by the laws\\n                 of physics. When scientific progress augments or revises those laws, our picture of what\\n                 computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is generally accepted as the\\n                 fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behave. Quantum computers can\\n                 in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computational tasks that classical com-\\n                 puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should turn out to be incomplete\\n                 or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will change. In addition, the set\\n                 of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essentially any coherent quantum\\n                 phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom can\\n                 in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This paper discusses how the revi-\\n                 sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phenomena can lead to new\\n                 technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.\\n                      Since new quantum effects are discovered seemingly every day, let‚Äôs first discuss two\\n                 basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum\\n                 computation. These are 1) The phenomenon must be nonlinear, and 2) It must be coherent.\\n                 To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some form of nonlinearity, e.g.,\\n                 a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom. Without such a nonlinearity\\n                 quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot perform even so simple a nonlinear\\n                 operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisite for performing tasks\\n                 such as factoring using Shor‚Äôs algorithm [10], quantum simulation a la Feynman [11] and\\n                 Lloyd [12], or Grover‚Äôs data-base search algorithm [13], all of which require extended\\n                 manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.\\n\\n                                                                        1', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '066b2185-7165-468b-84f7-b8866f9baa4f', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '      The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-\\nnomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in principle sufficient. As shown\\nin [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-\\nfices to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be assembled into a quantum\\ncomputer. In addition, the work of Preskill et al. [18] on robust quantum computation\\nshows that an error rate of no more than 10‚àí4 per quantum logic operation allows one to\\nperform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principle.\\n      In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are likely to prove sufficiently\\ncontrollable to provide extended quantum computation. Promising devices under current\\nexperimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high finesse cavities for manipulating\\nlight and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and molecular systems that can be\\nmade to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Such devices store quantum\\ninformation on the states of quantum systems such as photons, atoms, or nuclei, and\\naccomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the\\napplication of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser fields. We will call such\\ndevices ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been\\nconstructed.\\n      There is another sense in which such computers are conventional: although the de-\\nvices described above have already been used to explore new regimes in physics and to\\ncreate and investigate the properties of new and exotic quantum states of matter, they\\nfunction according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the\\nmost striking examples of the ‚Äòconventionality‚Äô of current quantum logic devices are NMR\\nquantum microprocessors that are operated using techniques that have been refined for\\nalmost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though\\ncertainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electrodynamic regime where the\\nfundamental physics has been understood for decades (that is not to say that new and\\nunexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime, rather that there is general\\nagreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).\\n      Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic device is the best kind of\\nquantum logic device to have around. It is exactly because the physics of nuclear magnetic\\nresonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this\\nphysics can be used systematically to construct and manipulate the exotic quantum states\\nthat form the basis for quantum computation. With that recognition, let us turn to\\n\\n                                                         2', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'bcf5f805-d98f-4076-aa8c-f753cf7dbfa1', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '‚Äòunconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n      Perhaps the most obvious basis for an unconventional quantum computer is the use\\nof particles with non-Boltzmann statistics in a refime where these statistics play a key role\\nin the dynamics of the device. For example, Lloyd [16] has proposed the use of fermions\\nas the fundamental carriers of quantum information, so that a site or state occupied by a\\nfermion represents a 1 and an unoccupied site or state represents a 0. It is straightforward\\nto design a universal quantum computer using a conditional hopping dynamics on an array\\nof sites, in which a fermion hops from one site to another if only if other sites are occupied.\\n      If the array is one-dimensional, then such a fermionic quantum computer is equivalent\\nto a conventional quantum computer via the well-known technique of bosonization. If the\\narray is two or more dimensional, however, a local operation involving fermions on the\\nlattice cannot be mocked up by a local operation on a conventional quantum computer,\\nwhich must explicitly keep track of the phases induced by Fermi statistics. As a result,\\nsuch a fermionic computer can perform certain operations more rapidly than a conventional\\nquantum computer. An obvious example of a problem that can be solved more rapidly on\\na fermionic quantum computer is the problem of simulating a lattice fermionic system in\\ntwo or more dimensions. To get the antisymmetrization right in second quantized form,\\na conventional ‚ÄòBoltzmann‚Äô quantum computer takes time proportional to T ‚Ñìd‚àí1 where T\\nis the time over which the simulation is to take place, ‚Ñì is the length of the lattice and\\nd is the dimension, while a fermionic quantum computer takes time proportional to T .\\n(Here we assume that the computations for both conventional and Fermionic quantum\\ncomputers can take advantage of the intrinsic parallelizability of such simulations: if the\\ncomputations are performed serially an additional factro of ‚Ñìd is required for both types\\nof computer to update each site sequentially.)\\n      As the lattice size ‚Ñì and the dimension d grow large, the difference between the two\\ntypes of computer also grows large. Indeed, the problem of simulating fermions hopping\\non a hypercube of dimension d as d ‚Üí ‚àû is evidently exponentially harder on a con-\\nventional quantum computer than a Fermionic quantum computer. Since a variety of\\ndifficult problems such as the travelling-salesman problem and data-base search problem\\ncan be mapped to particles hopping on a hypercube, it is interesting to speculate whether\\nfermionic computers might provide an exponential speed-up on problems of interest in ad-\\ndition to quantum simulation. No such problems are currently known, however. Fermionic\\ncomputers could be realized in principle by manipulating the ways in which electrons and\\n\\n                                                          3', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '53057fa4-ba5b-423b-a686-13c6953d5f12', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'holes hop from site to site on a semiconductor lattice (though problems of decoherence are\\nlikely to be relatively severe for such systems).\\n      It might also be possible to construct bosonic computers using photons, phonons, or\\natoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such systems can be highly coherent and support\\nnonlinear interactions: phonons and photons can interact in a nonlinear fshion via their\\ncommon nonlinear interaction with matter, and atoms in a Bose condensate can be made\\nto interact bia quantum electrodynamics (by introduction of a cavity) or by collisions. So\\nfar, however, the feature of Bose condensates that makes them so interesting from the point\\nof view of physics ‚Äî all particles in the same state ‚Äî makes them less interesting from the\\npoint of view of quantum computation. Many particles in the same state, which can be\\nmanipulated coherently by a variety of techniques, explore the same volume of Hilbert space\\nas a single particle in that state. As a result, it is unclear how such a bosonic system could\\nprovide a speed-up over conventional quantum computation. More promising than Bose\\ncondensates from the perspective of quantum computation and quantum communications,\\nis the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to ‚Äòdial up‚Äô or synthesize arbitrary states\\nof the cavity field. Such a use of bosonic states is important for the field of quantum\\ncommunications, which requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of\\nthe electromagnetic field.\\n      A third unconventional design for a quantum computer relies on ‚Äòexotic‚Äô statistics\\nthat are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Kitaev has recently proposed a quantum computer\\narchitecture based on ‚Äòanyons,‚Äô particles that when exchanged acquuire an arbitrary phase.\\nExamples of anyons include two-dimensional topological defects in lattice systems of spins\\nwith various symmetries. Kitaev noted that such anyons could perform quantum logic via\\nAharonov-Bohm type interactions [19]. Preskill et al. have shown explicitly how anyonic\\nsystems could compute in principle [20], and Lloyd et al. have proposed methods of\\nrealizing anyons using superconducting circuits (they could also in principle be constructed\\nusing NMR quantum computers to mock up the anyonic dynamics in an effectively two-\\ndimensional space of spins) [21]. The advantage of using anyons for quantum computation\\nis that their nonlocal topological nature can make them intrinsically error-correcting and\\nvirtually immune to the effects of noise and interference.\\n      As the technologies of the microscale become better developed, more and more po-\\ntential designs for quantum computers, both conventional and unconventional, are likely\\nto arise. Additional technologies that could prove useful for the construction of quantum\\n\\n                                                          4', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'de31f5a1-0290-45f3-b386-d02e3ed4c33c', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': ' logic devices include photonic crystals, optical hole-burning techniques, electron spin res-\\n onance, quantum dots, superconducting circuits in the quantum regime, etc. Since every\\n quantum degree of freedom can in principle participate in a computation one cannot a\\n priori rule out the possibility of using currently hard to control degrees of freedom such as\\nquark and gluon in complex nuclei to process information. Needless to say, most if not all\\nof the designs inspired by these technologies are likely to fail. There is room for optimism\\nthat some such quantum computer designs will prove practicable, however.\\n      The preceding unconventional designs for quantum computers were based on existing,\\nexperimentally confirmed physical phenomena (except in the case of non-abelian anyons).\\nLet us now turn to designs based on speculative, hypothetical, and not yet verified phenom-\\nena. (One of the most interesting of these phenomena is large-scale quantum computation\\nitself: can we create and systematically transform entangled states involving hundreds or\\nthousands of quantum variables?) A particularly powerful hypothesis from the point of\\nview of quantum computation is that of nonlinear quantum mechanics.\\n      The conventional picture of quantum mechanics is that it is linear in the sense that the\\nsuperposition principle is obeyed exactly. (Of course, quantum systems can still exhibit\\nnonlinear interactions between degrees of freedom while continuing to obey the superpo-\\nsition principle.) Experiment confirms that the superposition principle is indeed obeyed\\nto a high degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, a number of scientists including Weinberg have\\nproposed nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics in which the superposition principle\\nis violated. Many of these proposals exhibit pathologies such as violations of the second\\nlaw of thermodynamics or the capacity for superluminal communication. Despite such\\ntheoretical difficulties, it is still possible that quantum mechanics does indeed possess a\\nsmall nonlinearity, even if it currently seems unlikely. If a nonlinear operation such as\\nthat proposed by Weinberg can be incorporated in a quantum logic operation, then the\\nconsequences are striking: NP-complete problems can be solved easily in polynomial time\\n[17]. Indeed, NP-oracle problems and all problems in #P can be solved in polynomial time\\non such a nonlinear quantum computer.\\n      A general proof of this result is given in [17], however, a simple argument for why\\nthis is so can be seen as follows. Suppose that it is possible to perform a non-unitary\\noperation on a single qubit that has a positive Lyapunov exponent over some region: i.e.,\\nsomewhere on the unit sphere there exists a line of finite extent along which application of\\nthe operation causes nearby points to move apart exponentially at a rate eŒª‚àÜŒ∏ proportional\\n                                                           5', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '0777fa16-f0d4-4ad9-9877-a4abca0ba70f', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'to their original angular separation Œ¥Œ∏. Now consider a function f (x) from N bits to one\\nbit. We wish to determine whether or not there exists an x such that f (x) = 1, and if\\nso, how many such x‚Äôs there are. Using the nonlinear operation with positive Lyapunov\\nexponent, it is straightforward to construct a mapping leaves a point on the exponentially\\nexpanding line (call this point |0„Äâ) fixed if their are no solutions to the equation f (x) = 1,\\nand that maps the point to a nearby point cos(n/2N )|0„Äâ + sin(n/2N )|1„Äâ along the line\\nif there are exactly n solutions to the equation f (x) = 1. Repeated application of the\\nnonlinear map can be used to drive the points apart at an exponentional rate: eventually,\\nat a time determined by the number of qubits N , the number of solutions n, and the rate\\nof spreading Œª, the two points will become macroscopically distinguishable, allowing one\\nto determine whether or not there is a solution and if there is, how many solutions there\\nare. The map f need only be applied once, and the amount of time it takes to reveal the\\nnumber of solutions is proportional to N .\\n      The fact that nonlinear quantum mechanics allows the straightforward solution of\\nNP-complete and #P problems should probably be regarded as yet another strike against\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. Whether or not quantum mechanics is linear is a question\\nto be resolved experimentally, however. In the unlikely event that quantum mechanics\\ndoes turn out to be nonlinear, all our problems may be solved.\\n      Finally, let us turn our attention to hypothetical quantum Theories of Everything,\\nsuch as string theory. Such a theory must clearly support quantum computation since it\\nsupports cavity quantum electrodynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance. The obvious\\nquestion to ask is then, does a Theory of Everything need to support anything more than\\nquantum computation? So far as experimental evidence is concerned the answer to this\\nquestion is apparently No: we have no evident reason to doubt that the universe is at\\nbottom anything more than a giant, parallel, quantum information processing machine,\\nand that the phenomena that we observe and attempt to characterize are simply outputs\\nof this machine‚Äôs ongoing computation. Of course, just how the universe is carrying out\\nthis computation is likely to remain a question of great interest for some time.\\n      To summarize: Computers are physical systems, and what they can do in practice and\\nin principle is circumscribed by the laws of physics. The laws of physics in turn permit a\\nwide variety of quantum computational devices including some based on nonconventional\\nstatistics and exotic effects. Modifications made to the laws of physics have the consequence\\nthat what can be computed in practice and in principle changes.

In these experiments\\n                                     entangled photon pairs are produced, and the polarization correlation between\\n                                     entangled photon pairs is measured. Experimental results obtained in these tests\\n                                     are in favor for quantum non-locality. Although it has been pointed out that\\n                                     this polarization correlation is compatible with local realism [7], these results\\n                                     are generally considered as direct evidences for the existence of quantum non-\\n                                     locality, and more experiments [8, 9, 10] showing different kind of quantum\\n                                     non-local correlation are carried out. The entangled photon pairs are used as\\n                                     light source in these experiments, and the interpretation of the experimental\\n                                     results as proofs for quantum non-locality is closely related to the assumption\\n                                     that these photon pairs are in entangled quantum state.\\n                                          In this letter, I will show that the same polarization correlation also exists\\n                                     for certain un-entangled photon pairs. And on other hand, based on the consid-\\n                                     eration of momentum conservation, I will also show that the entangled quantum\\n                                     state is not a correct description for photon pairs used in these experimental\\n                                     tests of quantum non-locality.

The energy and the momentum\\nof a photon pair in the state |œàe„Äâ is equal to the energy and the momentum of\\nthe incident photon from which the photon pair is generated. But there is\\na problem in this argument, namely the parametric down conversion process\\ntakes place in nonlinear optical crystals, so one must take the photons and the\\ncrystal as one single system when the condition of the energy and the momen-\\ntum conservation is applied. The macroscopic properties of nonlinear optical\\ncrystals do not change in the parametric down conversion process. Thus the\\nexpectation values of the energy and the momentum of crystals are the same\\nbefore and after the photon pairs‚Äô generation.

One may\\nneglect the energy exchange between photons and crystals because the ener-\\ngies of phonons are much smaller than that of photons with same momentum,\\nbut the momentum exchange between photons and crystals must be taken into\\nconsideration.

The same conclusion holds also\\nfor ‚Äúentangled‚Äù photon pairs generated in a radiative atomic cascade of cal-\\ncium Therefore no physical phenomena that necessitate introducing quantum\\nnon-locality for their explanation are really observed.\\n           Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen (EPR) and Bohm had put the completeness of\\nquantum mechanics in contradiction to the relativistic causality by supposing\\nthe existence of particle pairs in entangled quantum states [14, 15]. But till\\nnow, such a contradiction did not occur, because no particle pairs in entangled\\nquantum states had been produced. Can particle pairs in entangled quantum\\nstates be generated ever? It is most likely not. Due to the interaction with\\nthe source of particle pairs, it should be impossible for the produced particle\\npair with different momenta to be in a quantum state with well defined mo-\\nmentum, such as the entangled quantum state. This observation is consistent\\nwith Santos‚Äôs suggestion [7] that only quantum states which do not contradict\\nwith locality requirement are physical states. From this point of view, the EPR\\nparadox is just a spectacular illustration of the restriction on quantum states\\nimposed by locality requirement.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] J. S.

Despite its importance, there is limitedresearch on market making in the Chinese stock market, which is one of thelargest and most rapidly growing markets globally. To address this gap, weemploy an optimal market making framework with an exponential CARA-type(Constant Absolute Risk Aversion) utility function that accounts for variousmarket conditions, such as price drift, volatility, and stamp duty, and iscapable of describing 3 major risks (i.e., inventory, execution and adverseselection risks) in market making practice, and provide an in-depthquantitative and scenario analysis of market making in the Chinese stockmarket. Our numerical experiments explore the impact of volatility on themarket maker's inventory. Furthermore, we find that the stamp duty rate is acritical factor in market making, with a negative impact on both the profit ofthe market maker and the liquidity of the market. Additionally, our analysisemphasizes the significance of accurately estimating stock drift for managinginventory and adverse selection risks effectively and enhancing profit for themarket maker. These findings offer valuable insights for both market makers andpolicymakers in the Chinese stock market and provide directions for furtherresearch in designing effective market making strategies and policies.\", 'title': 'Optimal Market Making in the Chinese Stock Market: A Stochastic Control and Scenario Analysis', 'updated': '2023-06-05 10:40:53'}, {'authors': ['Zhongyang Zhao', 'Caisheng Wang', 'Huaiwei Liao', 'Carol J.

Driven by the variations of fuel costs, systemloads and weathers, these market participants compete actively and behavevariously in the power market. Although electricity markets tend to become moretransparent, a large amount of market information is still not publiclyavailable to market participants. Hence, data-driven analysis based on publicdata is crucial for market participants to better understand and modellarge-scale power markets, and ultimately to perform better in power trading.While most of the previous researches related to the large-scale power marketsare based on the synthetic networks, a data-driven approach utilizing the realpower market data is proposed in this paper. First, the power plants' monthlynet generation and capacity data are obtained from U.S. Energy InformationAdministration (EIA) and aggregated to figure out the monthly regional capacityfactors which are used to characterize the market's regional behaviors formarket participants. Then, the regional capacity factors are analyzed againstthe metered system loads and natural gas prices to study the generationbehaviors in the power market. The analysis reveals the impacts of regionalnatural gas prices on capacity factors and the responses of generatingbehaviors to the system loads. The analysis results present the solid evidenceand rational references for market participants to model and validate thelarge-scale power market in the future.\", 'title': 'Data-driven Analysis of Regional Capacity Factors in a Large-Scale Power Market: A Perspective from Market Participants', 'updated': '2019-10-31 14:55:25'}]}, {'result': [{'authors': ['Peter Lodahl'], 'categories': ['quant-ph'], 'comment': None, 'doi': None, 'entry_id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02094v1', 'journal_ref': None, 'links': ['http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02094v1', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02094v1'], 'pdf_downloaded': None, 'pdf_url': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02094v1', 'primary_category': 'quant-ph', 'published': '2017-07-07 09:19:15', 'summary': 'Quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures have in recent years provento be a very powerful solid-state platform for quantum optics experiments.

Two-qubit gates and decoherence properties arediscussed for the RX qubit and the exchange-only qubit, thereby, completing thelist of requirements for a viable candidate qubit implementation for quantumcomputation. We start with describing the full system of three electrons in atriple quantum dot, then discuss the charge-stability diagram and restrictourselves to the relevant subsystem, introduce the qubit states, and discussimportant transitions to other charge states. Introducing the various qubitimplementations, we begin with the exchange-only qubit, followed by thespin-charge qubit, the hybrid qubit, and the RX qubit, discussing for each thesingle-qubit operations, read-out, and initialization methods, whereas the mainfocus will be on the RX qubit, whose single-qubit operations are realized bydriving the qubit at its resonant frequency in the microwave range similar toelectron spin resonance. Two different types of two-qubit operations arepresented for the exchange-only and the RX qubit which can be divided intoshort-ranged and long-ranged interactions. Both of these interaction types canbe expected to be necessary in a large-scale quantum computer.

We propose two new reconstruction methods that combines the taskof tomographic reconstruction with object decomposition. We demonstrate thesereconstruction methods in the context of decomposing directional objects intovarious directional components. Furthermore we propose a method for estimatingthe main direction in a directional object, directly from the measured computedtomography data. We demonstrate all the proposed methods on simulated and realsamples to show their practical applicability.

Despite its importance, there is limitedresearch on market making in the Chinese stock market, which is one of thelargest and most rapidly growing markets globally. To address this gap, weemploy an optimal market making framework with an exponential CARA-type(Constant Absolute Risk Aversion) utility function that accounts for variousmarket conditions, such as price drift, volatility, and stamp duty, and iscapable of describing 3 major risks (i.e., inventory, execution and adverseselection risks) in market making practice, and provide an in-depthquantitative and scenario analysis of market making in the Chinese stockmarket. Our numerical experiments explore the impact of volatility on themarket maker's inventory. Furthermore, we find that the stamp duty rate is acritical factor in market making, with a negative impact on both the profit ofthe market maker and the liquidity of the market. Additionally, our analysisemphasizes the significance of accurately estimating stock drift for managinginventory and adverse selection risks effectively and enhancing profit for themarket maker. These findings offer valuable insights for both market makers andpolicymakers in the Chinese stock market and provide directions for furtherresearch in designing effective market making strategies and policies.\", 'title': 'Optimal Market Making in the Chinese Stock Market: A Stochastic Control and Scenario Analysis', 'updated': '2023-06-05 10:40:53'}, {'authors': ['Zhongyang Zhao', 'Caisheng Wang', 'Huaiwei Liao', 'Carol J.

Driven by the variations of fuel costs, systemloads and weathers, these market participants compete actively and behavevariously in the power market. Although electricity markets tend to become moretransparent, a large amount of market information is still not publiclyavailable to market participants. Hence, data-driven analysis based on publicdata is crucial for market participants to better understand and modellarge-scale power markets, and ultimately to perform better in power trading.While most of the previous researches related to the large-scale power marketsare based on the synthetic networks, a data-driven approach utilizing the realpower market data is proposed in this paper. First, the power plants' monthlynet generation and capacity data are obtained from U.S. Energy InformationAdministration (EIA) and aggregated to figure out the monthly regional capacityfactors which are used to characterize the market's regional behaviors formarket participants. Then, the regional capacity factors are analyzed againstthe metered system loads and natural gas prices to study the generationbehaviors in the power market. The analysis reveals the impacts of regionalnatural gas prices on capacity factors and the responses of generatingbehaviors to the system loads. The analysis results present the solid evidenceand rational references for market participants to model and validate thelarge-scale power market in the future.\", 'title': 'Data-driven Analysis of Regional Capacity Factors in a Large-Scale Power Market: A Perspective from Market Participants', 'updated': '2019-10-31 14:55:25'}]}\n",
