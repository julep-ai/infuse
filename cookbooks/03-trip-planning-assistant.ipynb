    "## Task: Travel Itinerary Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Travel Itinerary Assistant helps users plan a travel itinerary that takes into account **current weather conditions** and **local tourist attractions**. By integrating data from Wikipedia for tourist attractions and using a weather API for real-time weather updates, the system provides a comprehensive travel plan tailored to each location. The generated itinerary suggests appropriate activities based on the weather, enhancing the overall travel experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input**\n",
    "   - User provides a list of desired travel locations.\n",
    "   - Each location is processed individually to gather the required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weather Data Retrieval**\n",
    "   - Fetch current weather data for each location using a weather API.\n",
    "   - Extract relevant weather details, such as temperature, weather condition, and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tourist Attractions Lookup**\n",
    "   - Use Wikipedia to search for the top tourist attractions for each location.\n",
    "   - The query format used is: `\"<location> tourist attractions\"`.\n",
    "   - Retrieve and compile a list of popular tourist spots and landmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Evaluation and Integration**\n",
    "   - Combine weather data and tourist attractions into a unified list for each location.\n",
    "   - Format the data into a structured tuple: `(location, weather, attractions)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Itinerary Generation**\n",
    "   - Create a detailed travel itinerary based on:\n",
    "     - Current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).\n",
    "     - Top tourist attractions for each location.\n",
    "     - Suggested activities categorized as indoor or outdoor based on weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-location Travel Planning**: Handles multiple destinations simultaneously, offering a consolidated travel plan.\n",
    "- **Real-time Weather Data**: Leverages weather APIs to provide up-to-date weather conditions.\n",
    "- **Tourist Attraction Discovery**: Integrates Wikipedia to find and recommend popular attractions.\n",
    "- **Intelligent Itinerary Suggestions**: Suggests indoor or outdoor activities based on the weather.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Itinerary Output**: Combines weather and tourist data into a user-friendly travel plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- A detailed travel itinerary for each location\n",
    "- Curated, up-to-date information gathered from weather searches and Wikipedia\n",
