    "\n",
    "This task involves conducting research on a list of topics provided by the user. The task flow includes performing web searches to gather information on the latest news for each topic, generating relevant keywords, and utilizing various tools to accomplish the task efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: \n",
    "   - The user provides a list of topics they want to research. Each topic is handled individually to gather relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Search and Context**: \n",
    "   - For each topic, a web search is conducted using DuckDuckGo to find the latest news and information.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Research Assistant**: \n",
    "   - The system analyzes the search results (HTML snippets) and generates a list of Wikipedia keywords related to the topic.\n",
    "   - A prompt instructs the assistant to identify relevant keywords based on the search result content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parallel Processing**: \n",
    "   - The task allows for parallel processing of topics to improve efficiency and speed up the keyword generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow allows for efficient gathering of research topics and relevant Wikipedia keywords, providing a comprehensive approach to in-depth topic exploration.\n"
