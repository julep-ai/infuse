    "       - Use deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery.\n",
    "    5. **Journaling**:\n",
    "       - Keep a record of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to gain insight and track patterns.\n",
    "    6. **Role-playing**:\n",
    "       - Practice new behaviors and communication skills in a safe setting.\n",
    "    7. **Homework Assignments**:\n",

    "       - Plan activities to balance rest and activity, especially for chronic pain or fatigue.\n",
    "    12. **Graded Exposure**:\n",
    "       - Gradually face feared situations, starting with less fearful ones.\n",
    "    13. **Skills Training**:\n",
