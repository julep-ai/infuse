The `memory-store` directory within the julep repository serves as a critical component for managing data persistence and availability. It encompasses functionalities for data backup, service deployment, and containerization, ensuring that the julep project's data management is efficient and scalable.

## Backup Script

The `backup.py` script within the `backup` subdirectory is designed to periodically back up data while also cleaning up old backups based on a specified retention period. This ensures that the system maintains only the necessary backups, optimizing storage use. For more details, see the `backup.py` file.

## Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is instrumental in creating a Docker image for the memory-store service. It outlines the steps for installing necessary dependencies and setting up the environment to run the service. This includes the installation of software packages and configuration of environment variables. For specifics, refer to the Dockerfile.

## Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications, specifically tailored for the memory-store service. It specifies the service configurations, including environment variables, volumes, and ports, facilitating an organized deployment. For more details, see the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Deployment Script

The `deploy.sh` script is aimed at deploying the memory-store service to a cloud provider, utilizing specific configurations to ensure seamless integration and operation. This script includes commands for setting environment variables and deploying the service. For specifics, refer to the `deploy.sh` script.

## Usage

To utilize the components of the memory-store directory, follow these general instructions:

- To build and run the Docker containers, use the Docker and Docker Compose commands as specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- To execute the backup script, run `python backup.py` with the appropriate arguments as detailed in the `backup.py` file.

This README provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the memory-store components within the julep project.
